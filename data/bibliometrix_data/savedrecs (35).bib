Abstract = {Lynx Lynx lynx hunting in Norway is regulated through regional quotas
   according to the magnitude of predation on semi-domesticated reindeer
   Rangifer tarandus and domestic sheep Oves aries. Lynxes and
   semi-domesticated reindeer were studied using telemetry in an area in
   Nord-Trondelag County, Norway, with high lynx predation on reindeer and
   domestic sheep and a high hunting pressure on lynxes. The probability of
   an ungulate killed by lynxes being livestock as opposed to a roe deer
   (the only alternative wild ungulate) increased with increasing distance
   from fields (P < 0.0001) and roads (P < 0.0001). Hunting was the only
   mortality cause found for radio-collared lynxes. The culling of lynxes
   was biased towards the vicinity of roads and cultivated fields compared
   with the general distribution of radio-collared lynxes (P < 0.001) and
   radio-collared semi-domesticated reindeer killed by lynxes (P < 0.001).
   Because of the easy location in rural areas due to the well-developed
   road system, lynxes suffered the highest hunting mortality in habitats
   where the proportion of livestock in the diet was lowest, whereas lynxes
   inhabiting alpine areas more than 3 km from the nearest road escaped
   hunting. The hunters' preference for hunting lynxes near roads leads to
   a risk of selective reduction in regions and habitats where lynxes do
   little harm, whereas numbers in remote areas with high predation on
   livestock may remain unaltered.},

Abstract = {The tolerance of lynxes Lynx lynx to human presence and disturbance in a
   hunted population in Norway was studied using telemetry. Forest land
   within 200 metres from the nearest road or house was avoided by lynxes
   when resting (P < 0.01). The tolerance distance of resting lynxes
   towards intruding people was short (median 50 m), though strongly
   correlated with the horizontal vegetation cover (partial correlation, P
   < 0.02) and forest maturation stage (partial correlation, P < 0.02), but
   not with terrain inclination (partial correlation, P > 0.3). The lynxes
   did not enter steeper country (P > 0.4) or alter their daily walking
   distance (P > 0.7) after being disturbed. The data indicate that lynxes,
   even when suffering extensive, man-induced mortality, may tolerate high
   human activity within their range as long as sufficient stands of
   undisturbed, mature forest with dense horizontal cover are present.},

Abstract = {Cultured Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) may be introduced into natural
   systems intentionally or accidentally. As smelts or post-smelts, they
   move to the feeding areas of wild salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean. As
   maturing fish, they return to the area of release and enter rivers to
   spawn. Lack of juvenile river experience is the prime reason why
   cultured salmon often enter fresh water later in the season than wild
   fish. During spawning, cultured female salmon from fish farms make fewer
   nests, tend to breed for a shorter period of time, are poorer at nest
   covering, and retain greater amounts of unspawned eggs than wild
   females. Cultured male salmon from fish farms exhibit less combat and
   display behaviour, have greater difficulty in acquiring access to mates,
   show less quivering and courting behaviour, and have lower reproductive
   success than wild males. However, cultured male salmon are more involved
   in prolonged, reciprocal fights than wild males and are, therefore, more
   often wounded. The reproductive success of cultured salmon increases
   with the time the fish have lived in nature before maturing sexually;
   for cultured females released in nature at the smelt stage, reproductive
   success is similar to that of wild females. The relative reproductive
   success of cultured males is smaller than that of corresponding females.
   Within both sexes of cultured and wild salmon, competitive spawning
   ability increases with body size. As a phenotypic response to increased
   growth rate during the first year of life, cultured salmon tend to have
   smaller sized but more numerous eggs than wild fish of the same size.
   Offspring of cultured salmon are more generally aggressive, more risk
   prone, and have a higher growth rate than wild offspring. Consequently,
   their survival rate in nature may be lower. (C) 1997 International

Abstract = {The genetic response of Atlantic salmon to culture is important in
   predicting the success of these fish in nature and their impacts on wild
   populations through competition and interbreeding. We compared a
   seventh-generation strain of farmed Atlantic salmon from Sunndalsora,
   Norway, with its principal founder population from the wild, the River
   Namsen. The fish were reared from eggs in a common environment and
   assessed for the extent of genetic divergence in several fitness-related
   traits. Morphology had diverged, as farmed juveniles showed more robust
   bodies and smaller rayed fins than the wild juveniles. Ecologically
   important aspects of behaviour also differed. Farmed juveniles were more
   aggressive in a tank environment typical of culture facilities, while
   wild juveniles dominated in a stream-like environment. Farmed juveniles
   were also more risk-prone, reappearing from cover sooner after a
   simulated predator attack. It was not surprising that growth performance
   was higher in farmed than wild juveniles, as the former had been
   subjected to intentional selection for this trait. Correlated responses
   to this selection may also explain the higher rate of smelting and lower
   rate of male parr maturity in the farmed than the wild salmon.
   Competition with wild juveniles, however, negatively affected the growth
   of the farmed juveniles, particularly under semi-natural conditions. Our
   results indicate that fanning of Atlantic salmon generates rapid genetic
   change, as a result of both intentional and unintentional selection in
   culture, that alters important fitness-related traits.},

Abstract = {Eggs and alevins were collected from 36 redds in the River Vosso in late
   March 1996, The redds had been made by 20 individual female Atlantic
   salmon and 12 female brown trout. Species-specific allozyme variation
   was used to distinguish trout from salmon and egg size and pigment
   analyses were used to distinguish farmed from wild salmon females. Nine
   (45\%) of the 20 female salmon spawners in the sample were of confirmed
   farmed origin, because their offspring contained synthetic astaxanthin
   which is an additive to commercial fish feed. Most of the remaining
   female salmon were also likely to have been farmed escapees because only
   about half of the actual farmed spawners can be identified by their
   astaxanthin content due to intake of carotenoids from natural food
   sources. The estimated peak spawning for both confirmed and putative
   farmed females was 32 d earlier than peak spawning of wild females. Egg
   survival was high and similar to previous estimates for wild and farmed
   salmon in the River Vosso. Based on the astaxanthin content in sampled
   eggs and the time of peak spawning it is concluded that most Atlantic
   salmon fry that hatched in the River Vosso in 1996 were produced by
   escaped farmed females. The frequency of redds made by farmed females
   was in accordance with their estimated representation (81\%) in the
   population of spawners during autumn 1995. (C) 1997 International

   the first scientific sample from a landlocked charr population from

   but 92\% of the fish were longer than 40 cm and 62\% of them fell in the
   45 to 54 cm interval. The age range was 7 to 31 years, but 93\% were 14
   years or older and represented 18 year-classes. The length-at-age of the
   charr seemed to increase steadily until they reached the size and age of
   the modal group. The growth rate decreased sharply after that. The
   mortality rates within the age span of the modal group seemed to be low.
   The ages at first spawning for most of the charr in the sample were
   between 7 and 9 years and spawning cycles of two years were indicated.},

Abstract = {The tissue distribution of the lipophilic persistent pollutant
   octachlorostyrene (OCS) in relation to the amount, composition and
   localization of body lipids was investigated in two groups of Arctic
   charr, which before OCS administration had been held on a restricted
   feed ration (lean charr) or fed to satiation (fat charr). Lean charr
   were only a little over a third of the size of the fat charr, with most
   tissues and organs having a substantially lower concentration of
   triacylglycerols but only a slightly lower concentration of
   phospholipids and cholesterol than those of fat charr. No differences
   were found between the two groups, regarding the size or lipid content
   and composition of the brain. The tissue concentration of OCS was
   positively correlated with the concentration of triacylglycerols and
   negatively correlated with phospholipids and cholesterol. The proportion
   of the total body burden of OCS deposited in extra-adipose tissues was
   higher in the lean charr (28\%) than in fat charr (13\%). The mean OCS
   concentration in the brain of the lean charr was almost four times
   higher than in fat charr. The results indicate an increased risk of
   xenobiotic-associated stress when storage lipids are depleted, for
   example, during the period in which anadromous salmonid fish undergo the
   morphological, physiological and behavioral pre-adaptations necessary
   for a successful seaward migration. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {Vegetation samples collected along altitudinal transects through the
   treeline ecotone in the central Scandes Mountains, Norway, were used to
   analyse the relationships between species diversity, species turnover
   and the performance of the tree layer. The study area has a long history
   of extensive grazing by domestic animals. The floristic composition
   showed a continuous change along the boreal-alpine gradient. The number
   of species was more or less constant throughout 600 altitudinal m
   centred around the treeline, and the Aoristic similarity between
   neighbouring altitudes did not show any abrupt changes at any particular
   altitude. The treeline position (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) spanned 190
   altitudinal m (range 980-1170 m a.s.l.). The number of trees and the
   basal area each decreased continuously with increasing altitude from 300
   altitudinal m below the treeline. The number of birch saplings also
   decreased from c. 150 m below the treeline towards higher altitudes.
   Viable, but browsed populations of birch were present along the whole
   length of all transects, irrespective of aspect and geological
   substrate, with saplings present up to summit positions at 420
   altitudinal m above the treeline. Due to browsing by sheep, mean sapling
   height at all altitudes above the treeline was 0.2 m. The results are
   discussed in terms of land use and climate change. It is concluded that
   future vegetation responses to diminished grazing pressure are likely to
   override responses forced by changing climate. Such responses could
   easily be misinterpreted as being governed by climate change, rather
   than by changes in land use.},

Title = {Migration of Collembola in a patchy environment},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {41},
Number = {6},
Pages = {494-505},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The overall output of migrants and the numbers migrating different
   distances from a habitat patch was investigated by pitfall trapping
   Collembola in a patchy habitat. Tussocks of Carer ursinae constituted
   the preferred habitat for Collembola. The tussocks were embedded in bare
   soil with a cover of cyanobacteria, and distributed with varying
   distances between them. In a previous study, it was found that
   Collembola show species-specific patterns of abundance and demographic
   composition relative to the degree of isolation of tussocks. It is
   hypothesized that species differences in migration rate, mobility range
   and colonization success are partly responsible for these distribution
   differences. In two series of experiments, pitfall traps were used to
   investigate the migration of Collembola out of tussocks. The captures
   were analyzed in relation to species, population size in experimental
   tussock and distance from tussock. This study shows that there are clear
   differences between species in the output of migrants from populated
   tussocks, and these differences probably contribute to the observed
   species distribution patterns in relation to habitat patchiness. Only
   Hypogastrura viatica showed a consistent positive relationship between
   population density and output of migrants. Hypogastrura viatica and H.
   longispina also had the highest overall output of migrants, and their
   high mobility can thus counteract the effects of patch isolation.
   Migration ability only seems to limit the distribution of one of the
   species (Onychiurus groenlandicus). Only a few individuals of O.
   groenlandicus were captured outside populated tussocks in this study,
   and the species is generally not present in the most isolated tussocks.
   Two Folsomia species (F. sexoculata and F. quadrioculata), appeared to
   have very similar migration abilities, although they have completely
   different distribution patterns with respect to habitat patchiness. In
   addition to the investigations on migration, trials on passive transport
   were done through net trapping on surface water from snowmelt. This
   appeared to be a mode of dispersal which primarily affects surface
   living species, but did not carry large numbers of migrants and is
   probably not of great importance.},

Abstract = {Invertebrate colonization of lakes following the uplift of land from the
   sea was studied in four lakes, currently situated between 39 and 24 m
   a.s.l., on the central Norwegian coast. The lakes were isolated from the
   sea between 9500 and 7700 years B.P. Animal and algal remains picked
   from core samples showed that the first colonizers preserved as fossils
   were usually members of the Chironomidae, Daphnidae/Chydoridae, Acarina,
   Porifera (Ephydatia mulleri and Spongilla lacustris), Bryozoa
   (Cristatella mucedo and Plumatella spp.) and Charophyta (Chara sp.). Of
   the chironomids, the genus Chironomus was present in the oldest
   lacustrine layers of all four lakes, but other genera recorded at the
   marine/lacustrine boundary were Dicrotendipes, Procladius (?),
   Einfeldia, Microtendipes, and Glyptotendipes. Remains of the caddis fly
   family Limnephilidae were also present in the earliest lacustrine
   sediments in Kvennavatnet and Kvernavatnet. The oldest invertebrate
   fauna is typical for mesotrophic lakes. However, chironomids and mites
   have been present in this area from at least about 10 500 years B,P. A
   diverse chironomid community was established between 300 and 800 years
   after isolation from the sea at Kvernavatnet on the island of Hitra,
   while only between 80 and 120 years passed before a comparably diverse
   community developed at Kvennavatnet on the mainland coast. A similar
   development of the invertebrate fauna occurred in Kvennavatnet,
   Kvernavatnet and Storkuvatnet. However, Litjvatnet deviates greatly from
   the `normal' pattern because a tsunami disturbed the bottom sediments
   and fauna. The tsunami, a gigantic sea wave, was caused by a submarine
   slide from the Norwegian continental slope. It reached Litjvatnet, today
   located 24 m a.s.l., but was not traced in Storkuvatnet at 30 m a.s.l.
   This event happened about 7200 years B.P.},

Abstract = {In species where incubation is shared by both parents, the mate's
   ability to fast on the nest may constrain the time available for
   foraging. The decision to return to the nest should therefore be a
   compromise between an animal's own foraging success and its mate's
   ability to fast on the nest. To examine how the body conditions of
   incubating Antarctic petrels, Thalassoica antarctica, influence both the
   length of foraging trips and incubation shifts, we experimentally
   handicapped females by increasing their flight costs during a foraging
   trip by adding lead weights to their legs. Handicapped females spent
   more time at sea and had lower body conditions at arrival to the colony
   than controls, and, moreover, females in poor body condition at arrival
   to the colony spent generally more time at sea than those with higher
   body condition. The prolonged time period spent at sea by handicapped
   females was associated with higher desertion rates than among controls.
   The time the incubating mates fasted increased with their body condition
   at arrival to the colony, suggesting that a high body condition of the
   incubating bird may reduce the probability of nest desertion.
   Accordingly, our results suggest that the time spent foraging is
   adjusted to the body conditions of both the foraging and incubating
   mate.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {To examine the link between early experience and subsequent reproductive
   performance, we experimentally manipulated the early experience of
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Salmon of a common genetic background
   were reared as juveniles either naturally in the river or artificially
   in a hatchery (sea ranched), depriving them of river experience, and
   then allowed to grow to maturity naturally in the ocean. At maturity the
   competitive and reproductive abilities of these fish were compared in
   four experiments quantifying reproductive success. Although levels of
   aggressive behavior were similar, the experience-deprive; sea-ranched
   males were involved in more prolonged aggressive encounters and incurred
   greater wounding and mortality than wild males. Furthermore, sea-ranched
   males were less able to monopolize spawnings and as a result obtained
   51\% the reproductive success of wild males across the experiments. This
   reproductive inferiority varied directly with the male density and bias
   in the sex ratio, reflecting the intensity of male breeding competition,
   A lower intensity of female than male competition was likely responsible
   for the lack of differences in breeding performance between sea-ranched
   and wild females. Sea-ranched females, however, produced smaller eggs
   than wild females, apparently in response to their higher juvenile
   growth rate. Differences in migratory behavior were also apparent, as
   sea-ranched males and females ascended the River Imsa later than wild
   fish. Our results indicate that early experience has implications for
   subsequent adult reproductive performance, affecting the development of
   specialized skills and traits important not only for early life, but
   also later life.},

Abstract = {Translocation of individual carnivores has been a standard management
   tool for decades in North America and southern Africa in response to
   livestock depredation and other conflict behaviours. As carnivore
   populations across Europe begin to increase it is expected that
   management problems will also increase. Before translocation becomes
   established as a management tool in Europe its success needs to be
   reviewed. In general, there has been very little follow-up of
   translocated animals. Almost no data exist on the subsequent levels of
   damage after translocation. Large carnivores have shown a consistent
   ability to return to the site of capture over distances of up to 400 km.
   Even those individuals that do not succeed in returning home roam over
   very large distances, best measured in units of hundreds of kilometres.
   Very few individuals remain at the release sites. Survival of
   translocated animals has occasionally been shown to be goer, often as a
   result of the large movements. In general, there needs to be a large
   area (hundreds or thousands of square kilometres) without conflict
   potential when the individuals can be released for the strategy to work.
   When such areas are not available, management efforts should concentrate
   on reducing conflict potential, or, where this is not practical, lethal
   control.},

   Ten Lone and eight Imsa salmon were equipped with internal EMG

   Individuals differed in their EMG resting levels (EMGs recorded at 0.5

   and an activity index (EMG pulse intervals at different speeds/EMG
   resting levels) (pooled data, r(2) = 0.75). The linear relationship

   general pattern of female biased dispersal established by Greenwood in
   1980. We report sex differences in dispersal patterns in natal and
   breeding dispersal as measured by 1) proportion leaving and 2) distance
   moved. Greenwood's review found evidence for male biased dispersal only
   within four species of the Anatidae. We find there is now evidence for
   male biased dispersal in twenty-two species representing twelve
   families.},

Abstract = {Wolverines (Gulo gulo) recolonized the Snohetta plateau in southern
   Norway in 1976-1979 after an absence of over 50 years. This is presently
   the southernmost part of the wolverine's distribution and the only area
   where it coexists with wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in western
   Europe. Other, larger predators in the Scandinavian ecosystem, the wolf
   (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and brown bear (Ursus arctos), have
   been absent from the area since the beginning of this century. We
   monitored wolverine numbers, reproduction, and diet during the denning
   period and studied the effects of abundance of different prey species on
   wolverine reproduction. Although there were differences in productivity
   among maternity dens, the main factor influencing the number of
   wolverine cubs surviving was the abundance of small rodents (p =
   0.0002). Although small rodents constituted the main factor explaining
   variation in cub numbers, the basic prey during the denning period was
   reindeer. Hares (Lepus timidus) accounted for a significant but stable
   part of the diet during the denning period. The wolverine was an
   important predator on sheep (Ovis aries), but we found no evidence that
   sheep are an essential part of its diet.},

Title = {A functional model of radiocesium turnover in brown trout},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1002-1016},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We describe a mechanistic model to explore the environmental and
   metabolic determinants of radiocesium kinetics in a freshwater fish, the
   brown trout (Salmo trutta). Our model, which incorporates submodels for
   fish growth, food consumption, ambient temperature, and radiocesium
   turnover, was validated and calibrated to observations in three
   year-classes of brown trout from a Norwegian lake contaminated with
   Chernobyl fallout. Observed growth and independent estimates of food
   consumption matched simulations. Whereas our model successfully
   described trends and seasonal dynamics of radiocesium in brown trout, it
   was highly sensitive to the temperature submodel with model uncertainty
   largely driven by uncertainties in absorption efficiency, feeding rate,
   and temperature.
   We used the model to simulate both fallout and steady-state (constant
   prey radiocesium) conditions. Peak radiocesium in fish after a fallout
   depended upon time of year, fish size, rate of food consumption and
   growth, and water temperature regime. Among the modeled lake types
   (temperate, boreal, and subalpine), peak radioactivity was highest for
   brown trout living in the warmest lake, feeding and growing at a maximum
   rate, and for fallout occurring early in spring. In these lakes,
   increasing growth rate from 80 to 100\% of the maximum nearly doubled
   peak radioactivity. The model predicted that the relationship between
   body size and fish radioactivity changed from negative to positive
   within 2 yr after a fallout. At steady state, the model predicted
   seasonal dynamics in accumulation of radiocesium, with maximum
   biomagnification in autumn and minimum in early spring. Maximum
   biomagnification was related to fish size (weak negative slope), growth
   rate, and temperature regime, and a metamodel was developed for
   predicting biomagnification.},

Title = {Soil and stream water chemistry in a pristine and boggy site in
   mid-Norway},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {348},
Pages = {19-38},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Stream-and soilwater at the 18.7 ha pristine Ingabekken catchment, on
   gneiss bedrock at Hoylandet, have been studied for three years,
   including intensive episode studies in spring and autumn. The site
   mainly consists of blanket bogs which are typical for these marine west
   coast climates. Water drains through the blanket peats by means of two
   major flowpaths. Each flowpath contributes to the stream with a distinct
   chemical fingerprint rendered by the soil/soil water interactions along
   the flowpath, i.e. they may be regarded as end-members. The soil water
   from the upper peat layers is the end-member representative of stormflow
   discharge whereas baseflow originates mainly from seepage of the other
   end-member, which is the mineral soil water from beneath the peat. The
   pH(BaCl2) of the soils that control the runoff chemistry during highflow
   conditions was as low as 2.6, allowing for a substantial pH drop in
   streamwater in the case of a seasalt episode. pH in the stream varied
   from more than 7 at baseflow to 5 or slightly below at stormflow. The
   lowest pH (4.8) was observed during early snowmelt due to release of
   meltwater highly enriched in seasalts. The fraction of exchangeable
   aluminum (AIS) was much higher in the surface layers of the lower
   reaches of the catchment than close to the water divide. This suggests a
   transport of Al, much like podzolisation, though downslope by a lateral
   flowpath. A Principal Component Analysis on the stream water chemical
   data shows the importance of water flowpaths in addition to dilution or
   ionic strength and antecedent conditions as a factor in determining the
   water quality. On the plane of the two major principal components the
   base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) were negatively related to {[}H+],
   and the total organic carbon (TOC) was negatively related to strong acid
   anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-). These relationships between the parameter
   loadings along the two main principal components remained indifferent to
   the effects of both dilution and flowpaths.
   Under the present conditions of low acid deposition, this sensitive
   system is effectively buffered by its weak acids and all released Al is
   complexed by natural organic acids. Similar boggy areas located in
   regions with heavy anthropogenic acid deposition may not be able to
   neutralize the mineral acids. A shallow water flowpath and a high H+
   saturation of the ion exchanger in the soils controlling the highflow
   chemistry may lead to discharge episodes where strong mineral acids are
   allowed to pass through the system releasing elevated levels of toxic
   aluminum in the stream.},

Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {348},
Pages = {49-68},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The surface water chemistry of Hoylandet has been studied by performing
   two synoptic surveys, during high runoff in the autumn of 1986 and
   during a low flow period in the summer of 1988. Based on water samples
   of up to 38 chemical variables from 75 sites, analyses show considerable
   variation in the chemical composition. There is a strong altitude
   gradient, i.e. very dilute poorly buffered waters dominate at higher
   elevations near the timberline while progressively higher salt content
   and alkalinities are characteristic at lower altitudes more dominated by
   forests. The influence of mires is less pronounced. The overall water
   quality is of oligotrophic nature with low concentrations of strong acid
   anions and metals known to be enriched under acidified conditions. The
   natural pH gradients are considerable but with no indication of
   anthropogenic acidification. The data provide little support for the
   hypothesis that in-catchment production of organically derived acidity
   leads to acid runoff, which in these catchments appears compensated by
   increased weathering. The findings are in general accordance with other
   Hoylandet catchment studies. It is concluded that this area may serve as
   a representative pristine surface runoff analogue for catchments
   currently affected by atmospheric deposition of strong mineral acids.},

Volume = {348},
Pages = {95-111},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Crustacean plankton was studied in 12 lakes in the Hoylandet area in
   1986-87. Basic lake characteristics are elevation 134-415 m, surface
   area 9-530 ha, pH 5.9-7.1, conductivity (25 degrees C) 12-40 mu S cm(-1)
   and Secchi depth 4-9 m. Number of species present varied between 3 and
   11. Population numbers between 4000 and 400 000 per m(2) and biomasses
   were within the range 30 to 1800 mg m(-2) dry weight. Cladocera
   dominated over Copepoda in lakes with allopatric brown trout (Salmo
   trutta L.), on the contrary to lakes also populated by Arctic charr
   (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)). These variations are caused by differences in
   elevation, lake morphometry, water quality, fish predation and the
   general distribution of the species. The largest lakes at lowest
   elevation were richest in species. The acid sensitive genus Daphnia was
   represented by 3 species. The lakes Storgronningen (530 ha) and
   Royrtjonnna (27 ha) were sampled monthly in the ice-free seasons of
   1986-89, and Storgronningen more intensively from June to November in
   1987 and 1988. The same 6 species of Cladocera and 5 of Copepoda were
   present in both lakes. Their life cycles were traditional or known from
   several other Scandinavian lakes. Mean seasonal biomasses were of the
   range 600-750 mg m(-2). At the species level, there were considerable
   variations between years in Storgronningen and particularly in
   Royrtjonna. No effects of human impacts on the crustacean plankton were
   found. The Hoylandet lakes are representative for Scandinavian
   oligotrophic to almost ultra-oligotrophic lakes. Storgronningen is well
   qualified as a reference system. The between year variations in
   Royrtjonna are so extreme, that any human impact could only be traced at
   a level causing the extinction of species.},

Abstract = {Habitat utilization and the life history of brown trout Salmo trutta and
   Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus were investigated in five sympatric
   populations and five allopatric brown trout populations in Hoylandet
   catchment, a atmosphaeric low deposition area in Mid Norway. There was a
   significant inverse correlation in abundance of epibenthic Arctic charr
   and brown trout in these lakes, indicating that the latter species is
   dominant. The largest numbers of sympatric brown trout and Arctic charr
   were caught in epibenthic habitat. In two lakes, brown trout to some
   extent also occurred pelagically, while pelagic individuals of Arctic
   charr were found in all five lakes. The main food items for both
   epibenthic and pelagic brown trout were terrestrial surface insects and
   chironomid pupae. Zooplankton was the primary food item for Arctic charr
   in both habitats. Although the age distribution was very different in
   the populations, neither species seem to suffer from recruitment
   failure. There was no significant difference in survival rates between
   sympatric populations of brown trout and Arctic charr. We found a
   significant inverse correlation between epibenthic catches of brown
   trout and the mean weight of 4+ fish, the most abundant age group.
   However, if using weight data for three-year-old fish, no such
   relationship was found for Arctic charr. Brown trout and Arctic charr
   reached asymptotic lengths of 197-364 mm and 259-321 mm, respectively.
   Both species typically reached sexual maturity at age 2-3, and no
   maturation-induced mortality was evident. We conclude that fish
   populations in Hoylandet lakes are regulated throughout their lifes by
   inter-and intraspecific competition.},

Title = {The ecology of brown trout and Arctic charr in two lakes in Hoylandet},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {348},
Pages = {127-143},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Food consumption, growth, fish length distributions, population sizes
   and habitat use of the salmonids in two lakes in the Hoylandet area were
   studied in 1986-89. The allopatric brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in the
   tarn Royrtjonna (27 ha) fed mainly on organisms at the lake surface,
   crustacean plankton, Trichoptera and Chironomidae. Only 5\% of the trout
   reached an age of 6 years and a length of 25 cm. Sexual maturation
   started at age 3 and a length of 14 cm. Through mark - recapture
   technique the number of trout >10 cm was estimated to 115 ha(-1).
   Growth, fish length frequencies and sexual maturation of the sympatric
   brown trout and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) in Lake
   Storgronningen (530 ha) were not much different. The Storgronningen
   charr fed chiefly on zooplankton which by volume represented 33\% for
   the trout. The food consumption of Storgronningen trout was at maximum
   in July with 2.06 mg food (d.w.) per g live fish and for charr in
   September with 1.26 mg food. The maximum size-independent growth rate of
   trout was 5.2\% day(-1) in late June, and for charr 4.1\% day(-1) in
   late July. Seventy percent of their seasonal growth took place before 15
   August. The charr stayed mainly deeper than 3-4 m, at water temperatures
   <15 degrees C. Brown trout stayed mainly the littoral zone and in near
   surface water of the pelagic. The number of pelagic charr was estimated
   hydroacustically to 50 ind. ha(-1). The charr spawn in the lake. Mean
   numbers of juvenile trout in the two largest tributaries were 26 and 48
   per 100 m(2). Their annual length increment was 2.8-3.4 cm. No
   indication of acidification or other human induced impacts were found.
   The lakes and their tributaries represent complex aquatic systems,
   representative for pristine oligotrophic Norwegian lowland lakes.},

Title = {The Hoylandet area - patterns and processes of a pristine
   boreal-subalpine ecosystem - a synopsis},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {348},
Pages = {145-154},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The research activities on soil-freshwater interactions and freshwater
   biotic structure and processes in the Hoylandet area during the years
   1986-89 are presented in this issue of Hydrobiologia. The 9 papers cover
   a range of topics from physiochemical gradients and processes in soils
   and freshwaters to selected aspects of freshwater biotic community
   structure and temporal variability. This synopsis aims (a) to present an
   overview of major findings, (b) to interpret the results in the context
   of air pollution effects and (c) to outline suggestions for future
   research activities in Hoylandet. The area has a sub-oceanic climate
   varying from 1100 to 2200 mm of precipitation normally originating from
   unpolluted airmasses from the North Atlantic. It is chemically dominated
   by sea salts, has low concentrations and low deposition of mineral
   acids. The catchment geology is variable and complex and consists mainly
   of various granites and gneisses. The soils are undisturbed `ancient'
   soils, primarily iron podzols associated with forests, or intact
   histosols with strong organic character associated with mires, often
   quite acidic. They are sensitive because occurrence of predominantly
   insoluble unstable Al-complexes may leach out if exposed to
   anthropogenically acidified soil drainage water and turn up as toxic
   inorganic aqueous Al in surface runoff. Small amounts of locally
   generated nitrogen compounds are mostly retained in the catchment. The
   water qualities of these Hoylandet sites are run by inputs of sea salts,
   hydrological processes including dilution of the base flow, or lateral
   surface or overland flow and in-catchment processes. Relative to
   affected areas, it appears that the inputs and catchment processes are
   in balance, i.e., that the inputs of strong acid anions, hydrogen ions
   and sea salts are equilibrated by internal weathering and other
   processes and integrated within apparently intact biogeochemical cycles.
   The overall result is that these soils remain a net source of alkalinity
   to the runoff. These results are confirmed by regional studies of water
   quality both at low and high flow which show that the humus and ionic
   content of the water decreased with elevation, headwaters being more
   dominated hv sea salts and dilution processes. Excess sulphate
   concentrations are low, and few if any sites appear anthropogenically
   acidified, the most acid pH's reflecting presence of natural weak
   organic acids.
   The resulting surface water quality allows a diverse aquatic fauna and
   flora with representatives of many acid-sensitive groups. The fish fauna
   consists of self-reproducing salmonid populations with normal demography
   and ecological interactions. Despite high in-lake mortality, both brown
   trout and Arctic charr exhibited normal age-class compositions, with no
   indication of the recruitment failure or high post-spawning mortality
   commonly observed in acid-stressed situations. The zooplankton and
   benthos in the lakes are inhabited by populations of several acid
   sensitive species, like Daphnia spp and Gammarus lacustris, and with
   dominance of mayfly species of the genus Baetis in the stream fauna. The
   diatom flora includes many species which are rare or absent in acidified
   waters. The observed gradients in diversity and biomass seem dominated
   by local environmental conditions which reflect natural rather than
   man-made processes. The pristine nature of the area also emerges from
   the paleoecological studies in Lake Royrtjonna which show that the low
   acidity of this lake evironment has persisted from preindustrial till
   present times. Suggestion for future research activities in Hoylandet
   are outlined.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {312-326},

Abstract = {Seasonal patterns of growth, lipid deposition and lipid depletion were
   studied in anadromous Arctic charr from a north Norwegian population.
   Samples were collected in late May when fish were migrating between
   fresh water and the sea, and in mid-July when the fish re-entered fresh
   water. A sample of maturing fish captured in mid-July was held in
   captivity until late September to assess lipid mobilization linked to
   the final stages of maturation. The fish increased substantially in
   weight during their 40-50-day summer residence in sea water (immatures
   from c. 300 to 600 g; maturing fish from c. 500 to 800 g), and body
   lipid stores were increased approximately fivefold. The carcass (head,
   skeleton and skin) was the major lipid depot, accounting for c. 50\% of
   the total lipid content when the fish re-entered fresh water from the
   sea. The muscle of the ascending charr contained 35-40\% of the body
   lipids, whereas the gut and liver each held 4-5\%. Body lipid decreased
   30-40\% during the period between the re-entry of the fish to fresh
   water and spawning; although lipids were depleted from all depots the
   carcass and muscle were quantitatively the most important. By the time
   of spawning, the gonads of the females held almost 25\% of the body
   lipid, whereas in the males the gonads accounted for <3\% of the total
   lipids. Females lost c. 80\% of their body lipid during spawning and
   overwintering, and, consequently, the lipid depots were severely
   depleted by the early spring. By contrast, lipid depletion in the males
   amounted to 50-55\% of total lipid in the same period. These data
   suggest that the combination of spawning and overwintering in fresh
   water imposes a greater load on the females than on the males. It may be
   that the severity of the depletion prevents females from spawning in
   successive years. (C) 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Abstract = {A dispersal model for airborne pollen based on assumptions about wind
   directionality, gravity, and a wind threshold at which pollen is taken

   approximation. The bivariate probability distribution of pollen receipt
   by flowers at the same height as the pollen source is derived. Gravity,
   vertical random movements, and vegetation density turn out to have
   similar effects on this distribution. Maximum likelihood methods far
   estimating the combined parameters from data with multiple point or
   continuous pollen sources, and one or move plant varieties, are
   developed. Using an example data set from the literature, it is shown
   that our model gives a better fit than more traditional descriptive
   dispersal models of the form e(-arb). We also show that estimates of
   important properties of the dispersal distribution, such as the
   variances, become considerably smaller using our model than for the more
   traditional models. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and
   evolutionary implications of these types of models. (C) 1997 Academic

Abstract = {Intraperitoneal vaccination of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., against
   furunculosis using oil adjuvanted vaccines causes visible
   intra-abdominal markers of apparently permanent character. The
   feasibility of these side-effects for discrimination between fish from
   vaccinated and unvaccinated populations was evaluated in an open study
   using samples of vaccinated and unvaccinated farmed salmon, and in a
   blind study using individually tagged fish from a sea ranching
   vaccination trial. Vaccines were trivalent, oil adjuvanted bacterins
   extensively used in Norwegian aquaculture. Adhesions between internal
   organs and the gut wall were more sensitive and more specific for
   identifying fish from vaccinated populations than pigmentations on the
   peritoneum or on the viscera of the fish. Samples of farmed fish drawn
   from 3 to 35 months after vaccination yielded sensitivities of 93-100\%
   and a specificity of 100\% for this marker trait. In the blind study,
   intraperitoneal inoculation of saline as a placebo was found to induce
   minor adhesions, thus reducing the specificity of the adhesion marker to
   75\%. Using the observed sensitivities and specificities in a data
   simulation, the intra-abdominal adhesion marker proved feasible for the
   identification of fish from unvaccinated populations even under
   unfavourable sampling situations, Provided the current practices of
   vaccinating farmed salmon prevail, exclusion of individual fish carrying
   the intra-abdominal adhesion marker is recommended when estimating the
   number of wild salmon stocks, and when selecting broodfish for
   propagation of specific river populations of Atlantic salmon. (C) 1997

Abstract = {We examined how variation in parental quality influences the
   reproductive success of a long-lived seabird, the Antarctic Petrel
   (Thalassoica antarctica). In particular, we focused on how quality of
   parents can interact with and influence the effects of stochastic
   variation in the environment due to varying climatic conditions. Large
   annual variation was found in reproductive success. However, body mass
   of individual chicks at the end and beginning of the nestling period was
   strongly correlated in two of the study years, suggesting consistent
   variation among parents in their ability to feed offspring. Furthermore,
   chick mass was related both to overall body size and to body mass of
   their parents. Short brooding-shift intervals also were important for
   growth and survival of chicks. The probability of chick survival to the
   age of 30 days (ca. two weeks before fledging) was strongly correlated
   with chick mass when the chick was left unattended. However, the
   relative importance of different parental characteristics differed
   between years. These results show that reproductive success of the
   Antarctic Petrel is influenced by stochastic variation in the
   environment, probably related to climatic conditions. Effects of this
   stochastic variation may depend on body mass and/or body condition of
   the parents.},

Title = {Compatibility of brown bear Ursus arctos and free-ranging sheep in

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {In 1992, the Norwegian Parliament adopted a plan for brown bear Ursus
   arctos management. The main goal of the plan was two-fold: (1) ensure
   viable bear populations within five core areas along the border of
   neighbouring countries; and (2) limit the damage caused by bear on sheep
   Ovis aries grazing on open rangeland which has increased over the last
   few years. In this study we have examined the possibility of attaining
   both these political aims. Sheep losses in title study areas within bear
   core areas rose considerably during the period 1981-1993, when the
   Scandinavian bear population increased by 1.5\% a year. We found a
   significant correlation between the estimated number of bears and the
   loss of grazing ewes in both areas. No such relationship was found in
   the control areas (considered to be without bears) adjacent to the study
   area. We found no relationship between number of ew:es lost and number
   of ewes grazing. Shooting of bears that presumably killed sheep had no
   effect on the number of ewes lost during the following season, probably
   because the number of bears killed in Norway was less than the number of
   bears immigrating from Sweden. Killing more bears is not compatible with
   the political aims of the management plan. It is difficult to reach all
   the political goals under the current situation. The loss of sheep will
   probably continue to increase unless changes are made in sheep husbandry
   methods in the core areas. Alternatively, sheep must be moved out of the
   areas set aside for the re-establishment of bears. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   deer Capreolus capreolus and semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus)
   compared to small game (mountain hare Lepus timidus and tetraonids) than
   females did. Only 5.4\% of the variation in prey preference towards
   small game and cervids (p = 0.0002) could be explained by sex. In a
   logistic regression model, no additive effect of weight or any other
   parameters was found after sex had been included. We did not find
   sufficient evidence for body weight (sensu stricto) being related to
   prey choice, but propose that sexually determined prey segregation in
   lynx is caused by different ranging behaviour resulting in different

Abstract = {1. To evaluate differences in energy allocation to gonadal development
   of resident and anadromous Brown Trout, Salmo trutta, we analysed tissue
   composition and energy contents of adults of the two morphs from three
   small streams in southernmost Norway. Somatic energy per unit mass of
   anadromous spawners (5.0 +/- 0.6 kJ g(-1) wet weight) was 1.1 times that
   of the residents, This difference was chiefly due to a 1.4-times higher
   lipid content in anadromous (4.9 +/- 1.5\%) than resident trout. The
   somatic protein and carbohydrate contents per unit mass were higher in
   resident than anadromous fish.
   2. Somatic energy content per unit mass increased linearly with body
   length in resident but not anadromous fish. This increase was due to a
   significant increase in lipid content with fish size in resident
   contrary to anadromous trout.
   3. The mass-specific energy content of the ovaries was higher for
   residents (8.4 +/- 0.4 kJ g(-1) wet weight) than anadromous (7.81 +/-
   0.5 kJ g(-1) wet weight) trout. This was due to higher lipid and protein
   contents per unit mass in resident than anadromous females. In males, no
   similar differences between morphs were found (5.9 +/- 0.8 kJ g(-1) wet
   weight), The mass-specific energy content of the ovaries was c. 1.4
   higher than that of the testes, mainly caused by a 2.3-2.6 higher lipid
   content per unit mass of eggs.
   4. The mean gonadosomatic index (kJ \%) was higher in anadromous (34.0
   +/- 9.4) than resident (28.6 +/- 5.5) females, but not in males
   (approximate to 3\%). In females, but not in males, gonadal energy
   increased linearly with increasing somatic energy of the fish.
   5. Female gonadal energy at corresponding somatic energies was higher
   than that of males. On average, the energetic investment in gonads
   relative to soma of first-time spawners in the year of maturation was
   estimated at 11 \% in males and 67\% in females.},

Abstract = {Guidelines for landscape management acknowledge woodland edges for
   providing important biological and amenity functions, as well as
   functional and economical benefits for farmland and forestry production.
   Afforestation of many areas of European agricultural landscapes, due to
   changes in agricultural politics, will lead to a considerable increase
   in woodland edges over the next decades. In many countries this
   development coincides with an increasing emphasis on the multiple use of
   forest landscapes, e.g. a combination of recreation, biodiversity and
   production objectives. The potential role of woodland edges in nature
   conservation and landscape planning is raised. This paper focuses on
   woodland edges in agricultural landscapes and examines their major
   biological and amenity functions in the context of multiple-use
   management and design. The structural properties important for
   biological diversity and amenity values are discussed and compared for
   compatibility. We argue that the factors of greatest significance in
   determining the functions of woodland edges are width, physical
   structure and the composition of woody species, as well as their spatial
   dynamics at both site and landscape levels. Aspects of the design and
   management of woodland edges to achieve multi-functional objectives are
   discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {425-436},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {1. There were marked changes in the relative lipid content of somatic
   and visceral tissues during the course of upstream migration and
   spawning. The lipid content per 100 g wet tissue mass was high in
   maturing salmon in July (soma, pooled sexes: 12.1 g; viscera: 11.4 g in
   males and 7.3 g in females) and decreased to a minimum after spawning in
   November (soma: 2.1 g; viscera: 1.6 g). Percentages of protein in the
   soma and viscera were relatively stable during the study period, ranging
   from 21.9 g (soma) and 16.3 g (viscera) 100 g(-1) tissue in maturing
   fish in September-October, to 17.1 g (soma) and 16.1 g(viscera) in spent
   salmon. The carbohydrate content was relatively small, ranging between
   0.27 and 2.4 g 100 g(-1) wet tissue mass.
   2. Application of energetic coefficients suggested that the somatic
   energy content decreased from 814 kJ 100 g(-1) wet tissue mass in
   maturing salmon (pooled sexes) caught in coastal waters in July, to 370
   kJ in spent fish in the river in November. Visceral energy density
   decreased in the same period, from 706 kJ in males and 570 kJ in females
   to 340 kJ and 360 kJ, respectively.
   3. Mean gonadosomatic index (GSI) values, in terms of energy of males,
   in July and just prior to spawning were 0.4 and 3.2, respectively. The
   corresponding figures for females were 2.8 and 28.6.
   4. Gonadal energy contents per unit tissue mass were estimated to be
   higher in females than males, except for spent fish. Prior to spawning
   energy content was 845 kJ 100 g(-1) gonad wet mass in females and 375 kJ
   in males. After spawning the gonadal energy contents were 280 kJ and 385
   kJ 100 g(-1) wet mass, respectively.
   5. The relative energy, lipid and protein contents of somatic, visceral
   and gonadal tissues were highly correlated with percentage tissue water.
   6. Total energy loss due to migration and spawning was between 60\% and
   70\% of the body reserves prior to upstream migration. It was similar
   for males and females, but higher in large than small salmon. Estimated
   energy investment due to reproduction correlated significantly with
   estimated survival rates in 12 Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon.},

Abstract = {Wolverine (Gulo gulo) predation on sheep (Ovis aces) on summer range in
   mountain areas has been documented in Norway during the last 15 years.
   Norweigan government policy is to sustain viable wolverine populations.
   However, the conflict created by wolverine predation on sheep and
   domestic reindeer results in strong local pressure for licenses to kill
   wolverines, and results as well in illegal killing. Illegal killing
   poses a threat to sustainable management of this protected species.
   Because sheep are present only in the alpine ecosystem during the short
   summer period, wolverine populations probably are not dependent on sheep
   predation. The aim of our study was to find nonlethal taste and
   olfactory agents that have an aversive effect on wolverines. We showed
   that certain chemicals and oils are potential aversive agents for
   captive wolverines by adding small amounts of chemicals to die normal
   diet, and by observing their reaction both directly and through video
   analysis. Five oils and 3 chemicals in combination Sate distinctive
   aversive reactions and were considered a good choice for tests in the
   field with wild wolverines. Development of dispensers is necessary for
   using the chemicals as long-lasting repellents on sheep. Volatile
   repellents attached to lambs are a potential method for decreasing
   wolverine predation on sheep.},

Abstract = {Subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes are the sites of increased
   meiotic recombination and have a male-to-female recombination ratio that
   is higher than elsewhere in the genome. We isolated two novel,
   polymorphic CA repeat markers from the distal part of the immunoglobulin
   heavy chain gene cluster, approximately 90 and 200 kb hom the telomere
   of chromosome 14q. The 14q telomere was unambiguously located by
   physical mapping of telomeric YACs and Bal31 exonuclease digestion of
   genomic DNA We then constructed haplotypes using genotype data from
   these markers and data from sCAW1 (D14S826) for use as a highly
   polymorphic genetic marker. Linkage analysis using the 40 pedigree CEPH
   reference panel and genotype data from these and other loci physically
   mapped to the terminal 1.5 Rib of chromosome 14q revealed an apparent
   increase in meiotic recombination within this region, relative to the
   average rate for the genome. Further, we found that recombination was
   higher in females than in males, indicating that the subtelomeric region
   of 14q differs from other human subtelomeric regions. (C) 1997 Academic

Abstract = {The relationship between dominance and throat badge size, body size, and
   body condition was examined in three small island populations of house
   sparrows, Passer domesticus, on the coast of northern Norway. Individual
   dominance rank in males was determined by observation of agonistic
   interactions in an artificial observation cage (one replicate in Dec.
   and one in Mar. in two populations and one replicate in Mar. in the
   third population). Previous studies had indicated that badge size
   signals status in house sparrows. In this study, because of the small
   population sizes and stability in their membership, we expected that
   prior information about fighting ability mould reduce the importance of
   badge size for the outcome of conflicts in favour of traits most
   directly associated with fighting ability. In two of five replicates,
   significant relationships were found between components of body size and
   dominance rank, but in opposite directions. The relationship between
   badge size and dominance rank was consistently positive, but
   non-significant. In a pooled sample of the three independent replicates,
   badge size was the best predictor of dominance, and no other variable
   explained any variance in dominance. However, the coefficient of
   determination was low and linearity of dominance hierarchies was poor.
   We therefore suggest that individual recognition may influence the
   dominance relationships.},

Abstract = {For species with very high energetic costs during reproduction we expect
   occurence during the reproduction season to be dramatically affected by
   the availability of energy. Recent studies have shown very high
   energetic costs of lekking for great snipe males, Gallinago media
   (Latham, 1787) and that breeding great snipes prefer to feed in soft
   soil with a high abundance of earthworms. We here evaluate the
   hypothesis that the breeding occurrence of great snipe is restricted to
   areas with very high availability of food. All the 125 registered great
   snipe leks in Scandinavia were situated in open habitats along the tree
   line. The occurrence of leks were analysed in relation to bedrock
   quality, soil chemistry and earthworm biomass. There was a strong
   positive relationship between soil pH and earthworm biomass. High pH
   values were found on or in the close vicinity of base-rich bedrocks. No
   great snipe leks were documented in areas with acid soil, even if the
   extent of acid bedrocks along the tree line predicts that 31\% of the
   leks should be situated on acid soils. Hypotheses, including both
   natural and sexual selection, for why breeding occurrence of great snipe
   is restricted to areas with high abundance of high quality food are
   evaluated, and we find indications for this to be a consequence of the
   very high energetic costs for the lekking males. These costs have
   probably evolved through female mate choice and indicate that sexual
   selection may have important consequences for a species distribution.
   Population-level effects of sexual selection have previously received
   little attention. The stringent habitat demands here documented may also
   make great snipes vulnerable to environmental changes and can contribute
   to explain the dramatic reduction in breeding range of this species in
   western Europe during the past 150 years (Lofaldli et al., 1989).},

Abstract = {There is concern that the progeny resulting from the spawnings of
   escaped farmed Atlantic salmon may compete with and disrupt native
   salmon populations. This study compared, both in the hatchery and in the
   wild, fitness-related traits and examined interactions among farmed,
   native and hybrid 0(+) parr derived from controlled crosses and reared
   under common conditions. The farmed salmon were seventh-generation fish
   from the principal commercial strain in Norway and native salmon were
   from the rivers Imsa and Lone, Norway. In the hatchery, farmed salmon
   were more aggressive than both native populations and tended to dominate
   them in pairwise contests. Farmed salmon were also more prone to risk,
   leaving cover sooner after a simulated predator attack, and had higher
   growth rates than native fish. Interbreeding between farmed and native
   fish generally resulted in intermediate expression of the above traits.
   There was, however, evidence of hybrid vigour in Lone/farmed crosses
   which were able to dominate both pure Lone and farmed parr in pairwise
   contests. In the wild, observations of habitat use and diet suggested
   that the populations compete for territory and food, and both farmed
   fish and hybrids expressed higher growth rates than native fish. Our
   results suggest that these innate differences in behaviour and growth,
   that probably are linked closely to fitness, will threaten native
   populations through competition and disruption of local adaptations. (C)

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a bumblebee mark-reobservation study
   conducted in a fragmented agricultural landscape, where bumblebee
   resources (forage, and probably also nest sites) exist mainly on
   scattered remnants of semi-natural habitat. The results show that
   reobservations of bumblebees marked while foraging were numerous and in
   general at short distances (less than 50 m) from where they were marked.
   In contrast, when bumblebees were marked at the nest, the numbers of
   reobservations were very low, even though monitoring of nest traffic
   showed the nest to be very active during reobservation walks. The
   results indicate that bumblebees do not necessarily forage close to
   their nest, and that caution is needed if foraging area and nest
   location are based solely on the observation of foragers.},

Abstract = {We examined the adjustment of parental effort of puffins by switching
   20-day-old chicks randomly between parents of known body condition.
   Among unmanipulated birds mass gain (5-20 days) and mass of 20-day-old
   chicks was positively correlated with the body condition of parents at
   day 6. During the first 5 days after chick switching 28\% (n = 55) of
   the parents deserted their foster chick. Parents which deserted their
   foster chick originally had a chick of their own that was smaller than
   that of those which did not desert their foster chick. Whether parents
   deserted their foster chick was also negatively related to the size of
   the foster chick. The mass of the foster chick was more important than
   the size of the parents' own chick in determining the desertion rate of
   chicks. The mass gain of the foster chick during the first 5 days after
   switching was positively related to the body condition of foster parents
   and also positively related to the mass of the foster parents' own
   chick, but negatively related to the size of the foster chick. The
   results suggest that puffins adjust their parental effort according to
   both their own body condition and the size of the chick. The latter may
   indicate the chick's prospect of survival and recruitment to the

Abstract = {We have studied the developmental stability (measured as fluctuating
   asymmetry of five meristic characters) of three populations of Atlantic
   salmon Salmo salar (rivers Imsa, Lone and Ogna, western Norway). All
   three populations were both sampled in the wild, and hatched and reared
   in a common environment in a hatchery (with water from the river Imsa)
   from fertilization until smoltification. Both the Imsa and Lone hatchery
   populations have been sea-ranched in the Imsa for 10 years, whereas the
   Ogna populations is novel to the hatchery environment. Individual
   biochemical heterozygosity was scored at 50 loci, of which 11 were
   polymorphic. There was no correlation between biochemical heterozygosity
   and fluctuating asymmetry at the individual level, neither when tested
   within groups nor when tested between groups. There were no differences
   in fluctuating asymmetry between wild and hatchery Imsa and Lone fish,
   indicating that the hatchery environment did not disrupt early
   developmental homeostatic processes. However, the Ogna hatchery fish had
   significantly elevated levels of fluctuating asymmetry compared to the
   wild Ogna fish, indicating that the hatchery environment was hostile.
   The Ogna hatchery fish also had significantly higher fluctuating
   asymmetry than the Imsa hatchery and the Lone hatchery fish.
   Maladaptation to the hatchery environment is the most likely explanation
   for the increased asymmetry in river Ogna fish.},

   Earthworm biomass was higher under cowpats on pasture, which increased
   the predictability of potential badger food. There was no difference in

Abstract = {Ever since Elton, the 3-5 year density cycles in lemmings (and other

   involved intrinsic regulation and trophic interactions. We have analysed
   yearly changes in fall abundances for lemmings over 25 years from two
   local mountain sites in South Norway. These time series appear to have
   an underlying nonlinear structure of order two. Fitting a piece-wise
   linear threshold model of maximum order two, the most parsimonious model
   was, however, of first order for both series. The resulting dynamics
   from this model is a limit cycle. Reformulating the model in terms of
   abundances yields a model which combines (delayed) density-dependent
   effects and the influence of the cyclic phase. The delayed
   density-dependence of one part of the model is consistent with an effect
   of specialist predators during the peak and crash phases of the cycle,
   although other trophic interactions cannot be excluded.},

Journal = {HEREDITAS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {127},
Number = {3},
Pages = {239-248},
Abstract = {Genetic diversity within and between two wild and one farmed population
   of Atlantic salmon was estimated by 12 variable enzyme loci, three
   single locus-and one multilocus DNA minisatellite probe. The farmed
   salmon were fifth-generation fish from one of the principal commercial
   strains in Norway and the wild salmon were from the rivers Numedalslagen
   and Tana, Norway. All three classes of markers detected significant
   differentiation between the populations, with the farmed population
   being genetically most divergent. The farmed fish showed less genetic
   variability than the wild populations, as all techniques revealed a
   lower (14 \%-45 \%) number of variable bands/alleles in this group.
   However, only multilocus DNA fingerprinting detected a significantly
   lower level of heterozygosity within the farmed population. Estimates of
   average heterozygosity within populations were almost identical for
   single locus and multilocus minisatellites (0.558 and 0.548,
   respectively), which were more than three times higher than for
   polymorphic allozymes (0.162). Estimates of interpopulation genetic
   differentiation, however, gave highly concordant results between the
   allozymes and minisatellites (F(st) range: 0.106-0.135). Our results
   show that fifth generation farmed Atlantic salmon differ significantly
   from wild salmon in loci others than those chosen for selection in the
   breeding program. The study also suggests that the choice of genetic
   markers for studies of Atlantic salmon depends on the aim of the study
   (within-versus between-population variability).},

Abstract = {The distribution and movements of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the
   Northeast Water (NEW) area (NE Greenland) were studied from 28 May 1993
   to 31 May 1995, using satellite telemetry. Between 28 May and 17 June
   1993 satellite-linked radio transmitters were attached to eight adult
   females in the NEW area between approximately 79 degrees and
   approximately 80 degrees 30'N, By 31 May 1995 the mean duration of
   transmission (excluding one radio that quit on day of attachment) was
   688.4 days (SD = 65.1, range: 541-718 days). These seven females
   generally showed a high degree of fidelity to the area between 78
   degrees and 81 degrees N and 10 degrees W and the northeast Greenland
   coast. The average distance between capture site in 1993 and spring
   relocation site in 1994 and 1995 was 116.5 km (SD = 81.9, range:
   3.8-210.7 km, N = 7) and 85.4 km (SD = 35.4, range: 38.7-121.8 km, N =
   5), respectively. The minimum polygon home range estimates averaged
   72,263 km(2) (SD = 71,059, range: 5,567-195,648 km(2), N = 7).
   Relocations were concentrated on the shore-fast ice and on the pack ice
   over the continental shelf, This local movement pattern may be
   facilitated by an anticyclonal gyre of the surface water between 78
   degrees and 81 degrees N, and a slowing of the south-flowing East
   Greenland current. A male bear marked in 1993 at the NEW was taken by
   hunters in Scoresby Sund (approximately 70 degrees N) in February 1995,
   indicating that some exchange does occur with southern areas of eastern
   Greenland. Maternity and temporary dens were located on the coast close
   to the NEW. Apparently the NEW area is suitable polar bear habitat, in
   that the bears have access to ringed seals on the fast ice, and on pack
   ice adjacent to the polynya.},

Abstract = {We investigated the effects of cohort, sex, litter size and time of

   highly reproductive Norwegian population. By repeatedly recapturing
   radio-collared individuals, a total of 950 weights were obtained from
   231 fawns of known age. In accordance with earlier studies, there was a
   period of linear growth during the first month following birth. Mean
   postnatal growth rates of 155 g/day are the highest yet recorded for roe
   deer; however, the mean birth weights of fawns were lower than those
   reported from populations in continental Europe. During the period of
   linear growth, we found no sex differences. However, growth rates were
   affected both by time of birth and litter size; fawns born early had
   lower growth rates than fawns born during or after the peak calving
   period, and fawns in triplet - groups had lower growth rates than either
   fawns in twin - groups or single fawns. Despite a fourfold increase in
   population density during the study, this factor was not able to explain
   variation in postnatal growth rates, although cohort effects on birth
   weight were evident.},

Journal = {ORNIS FENNICA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-37},
Abstract = {The mean subcutaneous fat deposition (MFS) found in dead diurnal raptors
   and owls collected in Norway in 1987-92 was compared to detect possible
   overall and intra- and interspecific seasonal differences. In general,
   the relative fat deposition rate was correlated with body size (P <
   0.001), and was highest in winter (P = 0.01) and in females (P = 0.02).
   After correcting for the size effect, species-specific differences were
   still present (P = 0.000), but the effect of sex disappeared (P = 0.34).
   We propose that the relative rate of fat deposition in northern
   Palaearctic owls and raptors reflects adaptations to resist starvation
   balanced against the demands for high agility and low flying costs. This
   trade-off probably varies between breeding and non-breeding seasons,
   sexes, and species with different migratory and hunting habits.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {3},

Pages = {35-38},
Abstract = {Winter den abandonment by brown bears Ursus arctos in south-central
   Sweden and southeastern Norway was found to occur in 9\% of 194
   bear-winters, based on 68 radio-marked bears almost two years old and
   older. There was no statistical difference between the sexes, between
   adults and subadults, nor did protection from military or
   timber-harvesting activities reduce the rate of abandonment. Although
   anecdotal, observations suggest that human disturbance was a major cause
   of den abandonment. Most abandonment occurred early in the denning
   period, before mid-winter. Bears moved up to 30 km before denning again.
   Distance was not related to sex, age, or time of abandonment. Apparently
   for the first time, a fitness cost of den abandonment is documented:
   pregnant females that changed dens prior to parturition lost young in or
   near the den significantly more often than those that did not move.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {89-96},
Abstract = {To evaluate hypotheses on why the European badger Meles meles uses more
   than one underground burrow ('sett') as a diurnal resting site, the
   distribution and utilisation of setts within territories were recorded
   for nine radio-tagged individuals in four adjacent social groups in the
   boreal forest of central Norway. The density of setts was low, but the
   mean number of setts within a territory (12) was higher than found in
   earlier studies in Europe. Natural setts were small, and though randomly
   distributed within territories the upper parts of south-west facing
   slopes were preferred. Between April and September individual badgers
   used an average of nine different setts. They moved frequently from one
   sett to another, except for two reproducing females which remained very
   faithful to one sett in spring. Random utilisation and frequent changes
   of setts support the hypothesis that badgers use multiple setts to avoid
   accumulation of ectoparasites. No indications which support the
   hypothesis that young badgers use multiple setts to avoid harassment
   from dominant conspecifics were found.},

Abstract = {A new maximum likelihood method to simultaneously estimate the

   equilibrium is developed, based on a model of multivariate genetic drift
   in a subdivided population. Motivated by simulations of this process in
   the simplified case of two subpopulations, problems related to the
   nuisance parameter q, the equilibrium gene frequency, are eliminated by
   conditioning on the observed mean gene frequency. The covariance matrix
   of this conditional distribution is calculated by constructing an
   abstract process that mimics the behavior of the original process in the
   subspace of interest. The approximation holds as long as there is
   limited differentiation between subpopulations. The bias and variance of
   estimates of long-range and short-range migration in a finite stepping
   stone model are evaluated by fitting the model to simulated data with
   known values of the parameters. Possible ecological extensions of the
   model are discussed.},

Title = {Reproductive strategies of Atlantic salmon: Ecology and evolution},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {379-416},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) show a diversity of life
   history, behavioural and morphological adaptations for reproduction
   which have evolved as an outcome of competition to maximize reproductive
   success. Reproductive traits of females have been shaped principally by
   natural selection for offspring production and survival, those of males
   by sexual selection for access to matings. Female Atlantic salmon invest
   approximately six times more energy in offspring production (i.e,
   gonads) than males and face an important trade-off between number and
   size of eggs to produce that will maximize the number of surviving
   offspring. Timing of breeding and the construction of nests appear
   adapted to increase offspring survival. The most important determinant
   of female breeding success is body size because it affords high
   fecundity, access to breeding territories and decreased probability of
   nest destruction.
   Asynchronous female spawning and the male ability to spawn rapidly and
   repeatedly results in male-biased operational sex ratios that generate
   intense male competition for mates. This has likely been responsible for
   the evolution of elaborate male secondary sexual characters associated
   with fighting and status signalling. Furthermore, it has given rise,
   through frequency-dependent selection, to two alternative male breeding
   phenotypes: (1) large, anadromous males; and (2) small, mature male
   parr. Anadromous males invest heavily in behavioural activity on the
   spawning grounds, searching and fighting for mates and courting them,
   with body size being an important determinant of their breeding success.
   This behavioural activity carries a heavy cost, as anadromous males have
   significantly reduced survival relative to females. In contrast, mature
   male pall invest proportionally more in testes for sperm competition and
   attempt to `sneak' access to matings. While this behaviour also carries
   costs in terms of subsequent growth and survival, male parr are more
   likely to breed again, either prior to or following a migration to sea,
   than anadromous males.
   While knowledge about the breeding of Atlantic salmon is detailed, we
   are only beginning to understand the ultimate causes and/or functional
   significances of their reproductive strategies. Predictive models of the
   life history variation are developing, focusing on the need for
   empirical study and testing of life history and reproductive patterns.},

Abstract = {1. Summer home range size variation and habitat selection of 35
   radio-collared adult female roe deer was studied, using kernel home
   range estimation and compositional analysis of habitat use.
   2. Female roe deer adjust the size of their home range in response to
   decreasing food supply, and the hypothesis that female roe deer utilize
   the minimum area that sustain their energy requirement cannot be
   rejected.
   3. Home range size increased with the visibility in the home range (the
   average distance at which sight is blocked by intervening vegetation).
   This supports the hypothesis that cover is important in reducing the
   risk of predation and thereby increasing adult survival.
   4. Female roe deer spend more time near habitat edges, supporting the
   hypothesis that different habitat types contain complementary resources,
   e.g. food and cover or different nutrients. Simultaneous access to
   several habitat types did not have any effect on home range size,
   possibly because variation in heterogeneity between different home
   ranges was too low.
   5. Females without fawns had smaller home ranges, possibly because they
   only need to sustain their own energetic requirements.
   6. The analyses of habitat selection inside each home range showed that
   the forest types, characterized by high densities of food and low
   visibility, were preferred, suggesting that habitat use is allocated in
   proportion to either food or cover or both.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A transplant experiment was carried out to examine whether genetic
   differentiation can explain geographical variation in the reproductive
   strategies of house sparrows Passer domesticus. Individuals from an
   inland and a coastal population in Central Norway were released on a
   small island, near the coastal area. No directional selection was found
   on any of the morphological characters from the release to the onset of
   breeding, but the proportion of the inland males that remained to start
   breeding on the island was smaller than that of the coastal males. The
   new environment influenced the time of egg laying which was, relative to
   the source populations, more delayed among the introduced inland females
   than among the coastal females. In 1992, chicks raised by inland females
   grew faster and were fed more frequently than chicks raised by coastal
   females. No difference was found between birds of inland and coastal
   origins in their breeding success and their relative number of surviving
   recruits. Transplanted parents from the inland fed their offspring more
   frequently than transplanted parents from the coastal area. This
   experiment shows that the plasticity of reproductive traits in
   combination with stochastic factors in the environment may lead to an
   establishment of introduced genes in small populations.},

Title = {Life history variation, population processes and priorities in species
   conservation: Towards a reunion of research paradigms},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-226},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We argue that a relationship between life history variation and
   population processes may form the foundation for developing a theory for
   variation in population growth rate. An examination of the distribution
   of 104 European bird species in relation to their clutch size and adult
   survival rate showed three different clusters. First, there is a large
   group of species which lay a large number of eggs and have low adult
   survival rate. The second cluster consists of species with very high
   survival rates and a clutch size of only one egg. The third group is
   characterized by species with high survival rates but still a relatively
   large clutch size. From these clusters of life history characteristics
   we argue that the species can be classified according to the quality of
   their survival and breeding habitats, respectively. The
   high-reproductive species live in favourable breeding habitats, but poor
   survival habitat. In contrast, the survival habitat of the survivorship
   species are very good, but the breeding habitats are poor. The
   bet-hedging species live in favourable breeding and survival habitats,
   but the annual variation in the quality of the breeding habitats is very
   large, favouring the evolution of a larger clutch size than in the
   survivorship species.
   In order to examine the effects of these patterns of covariation between
   life history traits on population dynamics we calculated the sensitivity
   and elasticity of population growth rate to a change in age-specific
   fecundity or mortality rates for one species from each of the three life
   history types. These analyses showed that population growth rates of
   high-reproductive species were more sensitive and elastic to changes in
   the fecundity among the younger age-classes, compared to the species
   from the two other groups. Furthermore, elasticity to variation in
   mortality rates was higher than to variation in fecundity rates in all
   three species.
   To provide a further link between life history variation and population
   dynamics the results from key-factor analyses of population fluctuations
   in birds and mammals were reviewed. In most altricial birds, the
   key-factor appears during the non-breeding season. In contrast, in
   precocial birds key-factors from the breeding season explained a higher
   proportion of the variance in the total losses than the losses during
   the non-breeding season. In the majority of the cases density-dependence
   was found in the losses during the non-breeding season.
   According to the Allee-effect, we would expect that the population
   growth rate should decrease with density at low population sizes. No
   evidence was found for the presence of an Allee-effect in the studies of
   11 bird species which were reduced to very low population levels during
   the study period. We suggest however that such an Allee-effect still may
   be important due to a reduction in the defence efficiency among
   predators or parasites, reduction in mating efficiency, or reduction in
   the foraging efficiency at low population densities.
   These results may have some important implications for overall
   priorities in the development of strategies for conserving species
   diversity. In particular, we focus on the securing of survival habitats
   for especially longlived species outside the breeding season.},

Abstract = {Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) predation on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
   fawns was studied using radiotelemetry techniques on an island in
   central Norway. Red foxes killed 48\% of the monitored roe deer fawns
   within 60 days of birth, and mortality from other factors constituted
   only a minor part (5\%) of the total mortality. The predation rate was
   lower in first week of life than during the subsequent 3 weeks. Male roe
   deer fawns were four times more susceptible to red fox predation than
   female fawns. We argue that these results reflect differences in
   behaviour between the sexes. There were some indications that time of
   birth may be important in determining vulnerability of fawns to red fox
   predation, with fawns born during the birth peak suffering more
   predation than fawns born outside the peak. The type of habitat a roe
   deer fawn used appeared to influence the probability of being killed by
   a red fox, and our results supported the hypothesis that hiding is a
   strategy to avoid predation in dense habitats. Fawns killed by red foxes
   used open grassland significantly more than surviving fawns, which used
   woodland to a greater extent.},

Abstract = {1. A large number of studies have reported a positive relationship
   between the egg size of birds and the subsequent growth and/or survival
   of nestlings, but such effects may partly be due to confounding
   variables, e.g. parental quality. In order to evaluate the potential
   effects of egg size, and of parental quality, on early nestling growth
   in the Antarctic petrel, we performed an experiment in which eggs of
   different size were swapped between nests.
   2. From a sample of 300 nests with eggs of known size, we selected eggs
   belonging to the lower quartile (small eggs), and those belonging to the
   upper quartile (large eggs), with respect to volume. Half of the small
   eggs were exchanged with small eggs from other nests, and the other half
   with large eggs. A similar procedure was used for large eggs. Growth and
   survival of the nestlings were recorded until 12 days old.
   3. Hatching success was positively related to egg size.
   4. Egg size influenced nestling body mass until the age of 3 days, and
   tarsus length was affected until 12 days old. However, these effects
   were not due to an effect of egg size on growth rates, but reflected
   instead the influence of egg size on hatchling size.
   5. In contrast to most previous studies, we found no effect of parental
   quality (as reflected in the size of own eggs) on foster nestling size
   or growth until 12 days old. This could be because egg size does not
   reliably reflect parental quality in the species, or because parental
   effects become evident only at later nestling stages.
   6. We discuss why egg size variation is maintained in this and other
   species where egg size influences parental fitness through the survival
   of eggs or nestlings.},

   relation to climate variables known to influence primary production. Our
   findings are corroborated by analysing differences in age at maturation
   in 21 cohorts of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland.
   3. In Norway the majority of females ovulated as yearlings and calved
   for the first time as 2-year-olds. The proportion calving for the first
   time at two years varied from 0.23 to 0.67 between regions and
   fluctuated from 0.46 to 0.76 between cohorts. On Rum, where age of
   maturation was delayed at least a year, the proportion calving for the
   first time as 3-year-olds varied between cohorts from 0.0 to 0.89.
   4. In a subset of yearlings culled in Norway at the time of conception,
   the spatial and temporal differences in ovulation rates were related to
   the geographical and annual variation in body weight.
   5. Both the spatial and temporal variation in the proportion of
   2-year-olds calving in Norway, and cohort differences in the proportion
   calving as 3-year-olds on Rum, were negatively related to variation in
   May-June degree days 12 months earlier.
   6. Although primary production on the preferred herb-rich
   Agrostis-Festuca grasslands was positively correlated with temperature
   in May and June on Rum, the proportion of females calving as three years
   old, was negatively correlated with annual differences in May-June
   primary production.
   7. We argue that retarded phenological development, during periods of
   cooler weather, enhances diet quality because leaf:stem ratios and
   digestibility of plant parts decline more slowly. Thus, weight gain
   during the early summer growth spurt should be rapid during cool
   May-June weather, increasing the probability of conception in the
   autumn.
   8. Since density-independent variation in food availability also
   influences fitness components which commonly have a more pronounced
   influence on population demography, for example offspring survival, we
   argue that our results highlight the potential importance of variation
   in weather on herbivore abundance.},

Abstract = {Smelts from several stocks of Atlantic salmon were released in the
   estuaries of, and 5 km upstream in, an acid river and a neighbouring
   limed river in southern Norway. There was good agreement between
   recapture rates of released smelts and physiological effects and
   mortality of fish retained over the same period in floating cages at the
   different release sites. Of the smelts released upstream in the acid
   river, scarcely any were recaptured as adults. The smelts retained in
   the cages in this river suffered from severe osmoregulatory failure and
   high mortality within a few hours. Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activities were
   significantly reduced. Exposure for a few hems to the acid river
   impaired the seawater tolerance of the the fish. The results suggest
   that simple physiological challenge tests of smelts after exposure to
   the water in which they are to be released may be a useful tool for
   predicting survival after release, and may help decide when and where
   smelts should be released.},

Abstract = {1. Escape of cultured organisms into natural ecosystems may threaten
   wild populations both ecologically and genetically. In the aquaculture
   industry, farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) often escape and enter
   the spawning grounds of wild salmon. We report experiments to assess the
   competitive and reproductive abilities of fifth-generation farmed salmon
   and their potential impacts upon wild salmon.
   2. The farmed and wild females had similar levels of competitive
   behaviour; however, they differed in reproductive behaviour and success.
   Farmed females displayed less breeding behaviour, constructed fewer
   nests, retained a greater weight of eggs unspawned, were less efficient
   at nest covering, incurred more nest destruction, and suffered greater
   egg mortality than wild females. As a result, farmed females had less
   than one-third of the reproductive success of wild females.
   3. The farmed males were even less successful than the fanned females in
   competition with the wild fish. They were less aggressive, courted less,
   partook in fewer spawnings, and achieved only an estimated one to three
   percentage of the reproductive success of the wild males.
   4. The farmed males exhibited inappropriate mating behaviour, that led
   to poor fertilization success, even in the absence of competition with
   wild males.
   5. Adult farmed fish are thus likely to be relatively unsuccessful in
   natural environments due to a competitive and reproductive inferiority
   apparently resulting from domestication.},

Abstract = {The River Inna in the south Norwegian subalpine region was regulated in
   1979-1982, creating a 6.7 km(2) reservoir with a 35 m range in water
   level. This reservoir inundated good habitat for wetland birds and, in
   general, provided poor habitat for birds. Along the main inflow river,
   but within the reservoir, a retaining dam was constructed after the
   breeding season in 1989 to create habitat for native ducks. The dam
   maintains a nearly constant water level about Im below the highest water
   level in the reservoir; this is especially important for ducks
   throughout the breeding season. The ducks showed an immediate response
   in the first season, increasing both in number of species and number of
   individuals of several species. To discern some factors responsible for
   attracting ducks to this pond, all ducks were censused at least 12 times
   each breeding season between 1990 and 1994. The numbers varied widely,
   both from one year to another and during each breeding season. Wigeon
   (Anas penelope) numbers after dam construction were highest early in the
   season. Tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) numbers mainly varied from one
   year to another, while long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) numbers
   varied greatly through the season. In general, variations in water level
   had little effect on duck numbers. Four species established breeding
   populations in the pond. Such ponds may be valuable for establishing
   duck populations in many areas otherwise unsuitable for breeding
   water-birds. Appropriate management may also improve the chances of this
   being a rich habitat for several duck species in the future.},

Abstract = {Models of female mate sampling assume that females independently assess
   the quality of individual males. However, several empirical studies
   indicate that this assumption may not hold true. Females may copy the
   mate choice of other females, for example to minimize the costs of mate
   sampling or to increase the benefits of mate choice. This study
   investigated if mate choice copying is likely to occur on great snipe,
   Gallinago media, leks. Whether the observed number of females mating in
   groups differed from a simulated number of females mating in groups,
   under the null hypothesis of no copying, was tested. There were no
   significant differences between the observed and simulated number of
   group mating females. Group matings were not more prevalent when many
   females mated on the lek, nor towards the end of the mating season, and
   were not correlated with male mating skew. The number of group mating
   females for different proportions of copiers in the population was
   simulated, and the results tested against the observed number of group
   matings. These simulations indicate that the proportion of copiers in
   the population was less than 0.2, and not significantly different from
   zero. It is concluded that mate choice copying is not an important
   factor in mate selection by female great snipe. (C) 1996 The Association

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {1996},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to increased industrial and other anthropogenic activities during
   the last decades, the arctic environment faces increasing levels of
   organic pollution. The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in
   the arctic environment is of major concern because of their carcinogenic
   potential and their effect on the health and reproductive performance of
   animals. There is an increasing demand for sensitive and relatively
   inexpensive diagnostic biomarkers, applicable for environmental
   monitoring in the Arctic seas to assess the human impact on the Arctic.
   As a first step to validate the use of enzymatic assays in fish as an
   indicator for environmental pollution, the hepatic cytochrome P450
   induction in the anadromous Spitsbergen Arctic charr was studied at
   several time intervals during 4 days following oral exposure to
   benzo(a)pyrene. Three different enzyme activities were studied, i.e.
   testosterone-6 beta-hydroxylation, the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation
   and the caffeine-N3-demethylation. Both the
   ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation and the caffeine-N3-demethylation
   activity (only the 1,7-dimethylxanthine metabolite was formed) showed a
   strong and time-dependent induction after exposure, Western
   immunoblotting revealed an increase in the amount of protein. In the
   exposed groups a clear time-dependent increase of protein reacting with
   anti-cod CYP1A was observed. Between the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation
   and the caffeine-N3-demethylation activity in the exposed animals there
   was a strong and linear correlation. There was no effect of
   benzo(a)pyrene exposure on the testosterone-6 beta-hydroxylation. The
   slow and long lasting induction, probably due to the low water
   temperatures 5 degrees C, can be regarded as advantageous for
   biomonitoring. Differences in inhibition (alpha-naphtaflavone,
   furafylline) characteristics between ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation rate
   and caffeine-N3-demethylation rate could be interpreted in terms of
   possible presence of more than one P4501A isoform in this fish species.},

Abstract = {The present study focuses on the distribution and accumulation of
   persistent organochlorine compounds in different tissues and organs of
   grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) pups. Thus, levels of drins (aldrin,
   dieldrin, endrin), chlordanes (heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide,
   oxychlordane, transnonachlor), DDTs (p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD,
   o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT) and 22 PCB congeners were determined in samples of
   brain, fat, and liver of 0 - 10 days old grey seal pups from the
   species' main breeding site in Norway. Whereas 10 different compounds
   were detected in the blubber, 8 compounds were detected in the liver.
   The concentrations of the two major classes of OCs (PCBs and DDTs)
   in-liver were both about 75\% of that in blubber. In cerebral tissue,
   only two PCB congeners were detected, and Sigma PCB was only about 1\%
   of that measured in the blubber. The distribution pattern of
   PCB-congeners in liver and brain differed significantly from that in
   blood and blubber tissue, indicating that the physico-chemical
   properties of the individual congeners and the lipid composition of the
   tissues are decisive for the tissue-specific pattern of congener
   distribution. A significant increase of the Sigma DDT/Sigma PCB-ratio as
   a function of blubber thickness indicates that DDT compounds are more
   readily accumulated in older pups. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {A system of easily defined plant functional types for a dry savanna is
   presented and related to climate data. To predict possible changes of
   vegetation in response to climate change, a system of functional
   attributes is developed. The attributes are based on both structural and
   functional characteristics and are chosen to be related to climatic
   conditions. plant functional types are defined as assemblages of plant
   species having similar combinations of plant functional attributes.
   Direct and indirect gradient analyses of a test data set show that the
   plant functional types as well as the vegetation described from them are
   strongly associated with total annual precipitation, precipitation of
   the wettest month and a moisture index (all related to soil moisture)
   and with temperature of the coldest month.},

Abstract = {A field test with synthetic dimethyl trisulphide as attractant in flight
   traps was carried out in Finnmark, northern Norway, in July 1992 and
   1994. The reindeer oestrids Hypoderma (= Oedemagena) tarandi (L.) and
   Cephenemyia trompe (Modeer) (Diptera: Oestridae), previously shown to
   react positively to dimethyl trisulphide on the olfactory receptor
   level, were only caught in small numbers, with no significant
   differences between baited and unbaited traps. In both years, however,
   the baited traps caught significantly more individuals of Calliphoridae
   and Hydrotaea anxia (Zetterstedt) (Diptera: Muscidae) than unbaited
   control traps. In 1992, Protophormia terraenovae (Robineau-Desvoidy)
   (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and H. anxia were the predominant species
   (78.5\% and 20.5\%, respectively). In 1994, H. anxia was the most
   prevalent species (73.6\%). Seven species of Calliphoridae were caught,
   with P. terraenovae, Calliphora vomitoria (L.), C. uralensis
   (Villeneuve) and C. loewi (Enderlain) as the most numerous ones.
   Dimethyl trisulphide is probably a decomposition product from bacterial
   activity and may be one of the major cues for calliphorid host finding.
   The significance of the reaction for oestrids on the receptor level, but
   evidently not on a behavioural level, remains unclear.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {65},

Pages = {381-388},

Abstract = {1. Life-history theory predicts that individual birds should invest in
   reproduction according to their current body condition and the future
   prospects for survival and reproduction. Thus, it could be expected that
   current adult body condition should significantly influence food
   provisioning rates, food loads and concurrent chick growth in the
   Antarctic petrel.
   2. In order to study the significance of parental body condition I
   correlated meal sizes, feeding frequencies and chick growth with the
   body condition of the parents.
   3. There was a strong correlation between the average meal size
   delivered to a chick and its growth rare. Adult body condition at the
   time of hatching was strongly correlated with the average size of meals
   delivered to individual chicks. Male and female body condition at the
   time of hatching and average body condition of the pair at the first
   incubation shift and at hatching significantly influenced the body mass
   of the chick on day 30. Male body condition and the average body
   condition of the pair correlated significantly with the growth rate of
   the chick.
   4. The difference in body mass at the age of 30 days of chicks from
   parents with good body condition compared with chicks from parents with
   poorer body condition was nearly double that expected.
   5. The results strongly suggest that the effort spent during the
   chick-rearing period, and thus reproductive success, is regulated by the
   body condition of the parents.},

Abstract = {Theoretical analyses of deterministic population models have shown that
   the maximum sustained harvest of density dependent populations occurs at
   the population density with maximum growth rate. This traditional
   approach to harvesting does not include the effects of a variable
   environment. Here we analyse by means of diffusion theory the dynamics
   of populations at risk of extinction from demographic and environmental
   stochasticity as well as harvesting. These dynamical results are used to
   derive approximate formulas for the expected cumulative harvest before
   extinction and the mean and standard deviation of the annual harvest.
   Analyses of these expressions show that the optimal strategy is to
   harvest at the maximum rate when the population size is above a critical
   size c, with no harvest below c. Numerical analyses show that c is
   relatively independent of the form of density dependence. However, the
   threshold c decreases with the degree of environmental fluctuations and
   when the maximum rate of harvest is decreased.},

Abstract = {The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is subject to commercial

   Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences were determined to examine the
   population structure of minke whales from the central and northeastern
   parts of the North Atlantic, as well as the Antarctic regions IV and V.
   The analyses include 345 nucleotide positions of the control region of
   110 individuals, and 250 nucleotide positions of the NADH dehydrogenase
   subunit 2 gene for a representative selection of North Atlantic minke
   whales. Maximum parsimony analyses and sequence divergence calculations
   did not reveal any genetic differentiation between individuals from the
   central and northeastern parts of the North Atlantic. These results do
   not support the International Whaling Commission's separation of minke
   whales in this area into different management units, and they are in
   conflict with previously reported results from allozyme analyses.
   Comparison-df minke whale control region sequences showed that the
   sequence diversity of North Atlantic minke whales is substantially lower
   (0.0065) than that of Antarctic minke whales (0.0166), and clearly
   demonstrated that individuals from these two areas represent genetically
   distinct populations.},

   Stability of the barren state and succession of kelp forest recovery in

Year = {1996},
Volume = {105},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Stability properties of the barren state of a kelp forest-sea urchin
   system were studied in northern Norway. The ability of the sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis to maintain high population densities
   and recover from perturbations, and the succession of kelp forest
   revegetation, were studied experimentally by reducing the sea urchin
   density on a barren skerry. Additional information was obtained from
   community changes following a natural, but patchy, sea urchin mortality
   that varied between sites. On the barren grounds, high sea urchin
   densities (30-50 per m(2)) is maintained by annual recruitment. Severe
   reductions of sea urchin densities initiated luxuriant kelp growth,
   while more moderate reductions allowed establishment of opportunistic
   algae (during spring and early summer), but no kelps. Succession of
   algal growth, after the severe decline in sea urchin densities, followed
   a predictable pattern. At first the substrate was colonized by
   filamentous algae, but within few weeks they were outcompeted by the
   fast growing kelp Laminaria saccharina. After 3-4 years of the removal
   experiment, the slower-growing, long-lived kelp L. hyperborea became
   increasingly dominant. Increased food availability after reduction in
   sea urchin density led to increased individual growth of the remaining
   sea urchins. However, the population density did not increase, neither
   from recruitment nor immigration from adjacent areas with high sea
   urchin densities. Possibly, early establishment of a dense kelp stand,
   may represent a breakpoint in the ability of sea urchins to reestablish
   a barren state. The ability of L. saccharina quickly to invade and
   monopolize an area may have both positive and negative effects on the
   succession towards the climax L. hyperborea kelp forest. Competitive
   interactions may slow the process, but development of a dense stand of
   L. saccharina will also reduce grazing risk on scattered recruits of the
   more slowly growing L. hyperborea.},

   2. Mean egg weight increased with adult body weight. On average, eggs of
   wild fish were 1.12 times heavier than those of hatchery reared fish of
   corresponding sea ages.
   3. Somatic fish weight (total fish weight less egg weight) explained
   27\% of the variance in egg weight in wild, 40\% in hatchery reared
   salmon and 30\% for the combined sample. Moreover, juvenile growth rate
   in fresh water as a second independent variable, significantly improved
   the explanatory power (r(2) = 0.43 for wild, 0.46 for hatchery salmon
   and 0.48 for the combined sample). Neither growth rate at sea nor length
   increment as juveniles in fresh water (smelt length) added significantly
   to the explanatory power.
   4. Fecundity increased with somatic weight in both wild (r(2) = 0.81)
   and hatchery reared fish (r(2) = 0.74), with hatchery fish having about
   30\% more eggs for a given body size than wild females. By adding
   specific growth rate in fresh water as a second independent variable,
   76\% of the variance in fecundity of hatchery fish was explained. In
   wild fish, the addition of egg weight as the second independent variable
   increased the coefficient of determination of the regression model to
   0.88. Use of length increment al sea and smelt length as independent
   variables did not improve the explanatory power.
   5. Total ovary weight increased with somatic weight (r(2) = 0.83) and
   the pattern was similar for wild and hatchery reared fish. Neither
   growth rare in fresh water nor at sea increased the explanatory power of
   the regression model.},

Volume = {77},

Pages = {169-176},
Abstract = {The response of moose Alces alces to military disturbance in a multi-use
   landscape was studied. Four individual free-ranging moose, fitted with
   heart-rate transmitters, were subjected to specific stimuli in
   controlled disturbance trials, and 12 radio-collared moose were followed
   for 3-week-long periods, before, during, and after large-scale military
   manoeuvres. In the disturbance trials the moose showed much shorter
   flush distances (the distance from the disturber at which flight began)
   and normal heart rate returned sooner after being disturbed by
   mechanical stimuli than after human stimuli. There was no significant
   difference in flight distance or maximum heart rate for these two
   categories of disturbance. There was a significant, inverse relationship
   between flushing distance and both flight distance and the time required
   for heart rate to return to normal. During manoeuvres the home range
   size increased, but only one moose within the disturbed area made a
   significant home range shift. We hypothesised that the greater fear of
   humans than of vehicles is due to the strict ban on hunting from
   vehicles, and to the familiarity with unthreatening, all-terrain,
   timber-cutting vehicles. We concluded that military activity of the type
   studied here is not especially detrimental to moose, and that the
   effects of their activity should not differ from comparable civilian
   harassment. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd},

   six of the seabird species breeding in North Norway. Only four of the 90
   paired data sets increased significantly, and the remainder remained
   unchanged. There was very little change in mercury levels. The decline
   in OCs corresponds to similar declines found in Canada and the Baltic
   Sea, and to declines documented in marine fish in a Norwegian fjord They
   can all be attributed to the reduction in use and spread of

Abstract = {A survey of the patterns of lignicolous fungi to record occurrence of

   Ninetythree forest stands with different ages, ecology and histories of
   management in Sor-Trondelag County, Central Norway were investigated. In
   each stand an investigation plot of 40 m diameter was established, in
   which five logs were randomly selected. Environmental variables of the
   logs and plots and geographical positions of the plots were recorded.
   The numerical methods used include detrended correspondence analysis
   (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   A total of 140 species of Aphyllophorales, Agaricales with eccentrically
   attached caps, heterobasiodomycetes, and prominent ascomycetes and
   deuteromycetes were registered. More than one third of the species were
   only found once. The main gradient in the data set was shown to be
   related to decay. The second gradient was related to size of the logs
   and some forest management variables (in addition to decay). Of the
   variation in composition of the species, 13.8 \% can be ascribed to
   solely environmental variance, 6 \% to solely spatial structure, and
   only 0.8 \% to the combination of the environment and spatial component
   of variation. The results are discussed in the light of wood decay,
   forest management, and landscape fragmentation.},

Abstract = {We investigated the adult sex ratio in 70 infrapopulations of the
   nematode Echinomermella matsi, a parasite of the green sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. The adult sex ratio was skewed
   towards female dominance at low adult intensity and towards male
   dominance at high adult intensity. We hypothesize that this is due to
   differences between the sexes in development and mortality rates, or
   that female recruitment is density dependent. A model with differences
   between the sexes in developmental and mortality rates may develop the
   observed sex ratios if the female developmental and mortality rates are
   several times that of the males. A large difference in developmental
   rates between the sexes appears unreasonable because the developmental
   rate for both sexes is low, and the predicted low female life-expectancy
   is unlikely because the males appear to accumulate in infrapopulations
   as the females age. Density dependence of female numbers is, however,
   supported by a significantly lower female recruitment in
   infrapopulations with old females. We also find that the mean male
   length is negatively related to measures of crowding, thereby supporting
   the hypothesis that competition is of importance in E. matsi
   infrapopulations. A female bias at low intensities of infection, a
   density dependence in female recruitment and the taxonomic position of
   E. matsi indicate that sex may be environmentally determined in this
   nematode.},

   By use of Monte Carlo simulations and GLM procedures, it is examined to

   merging different populations, only regional trends are considered. The
   results strongly suggest that some populations can be monitored
   adequately by less effort than that applied, i.e. still ensuring that
   the counts will reveal the various sources of variation in reliable
   proportions to the total variance in bird numbers. This may be achieved
   either by reducing the number of plots or by counting them less
   frequently, for example in alternate years only. General advise with
   respect to what changes deserve special attention from conservation
   authorities, and a discussion of the principles and considerations which

Title = {Sensitivity of willow grouse Lagopus lagopus population dynamics to
   variations in demographic parameters},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-35},
Abstract = {In order to estimate the potential importance of each of the demographic
   traits egg, chick, and apparent winter survival on willow grouse Lagopus
   lagopus population dynamics, a sensitivity/elasticity analysis on a
   general model for the growth rate of breeding hen willow grouse numbers
   was performed. The demographic parameters used were taken from a 21-year
   study of willow grouse population dynamics on a Norwegian island. The
   growth rate of breeding hen numbers may be sensitive to changes in a
   parameter either because of the structure of the model or because of a
   substantial between year variation in the parameter. Therefore, three
   measures of parameter importance were used: sensitivity, elasticity and
   an actual elasticity coefficient (AE-coefficient). Sensitivity is an
   unsealed measure of the impact of a parameter, and thus cannot be used
   for comparisons between different parameters. Elasticity is a scaled
   measure of sensitivity allowing direct comparison between effects of
   different parameters on the growth rate (lambda). To interpret the true
   effect of a demographic parameter on lambda. between year variations in
   the parameter must be accounted for. The actual elasticity coefficient
   of each parameter is the product: of the elasticity coefficient and the
   coefficient of variation, CV, for the demographic parameter in question.
   Sensitivity, elasticity and AE-coefficients showed that apparent winter
   survival of juveniles had the largest potential impact on changes in
   lambda, followed by egg survival, chick survival and adult apparent
   winter survival. Considering elasticity coefficients alone, apparent
   winter survival compared to survival from egg laying to four weeks after
   hatching had 2.3 times the impact on lambda. However, between year
   variation in apparent winter survival was far less than between year
   variation in survival from egg laying to four weeks after hatching,
   which leads to them both having a similar impact on lambda. Management
   efforts on willow grouse have largely been devoted to enhancing survival
   from egg laying to four weeks after hatching which was believed to be
   the single most important factor determining population size. The
   results presented suggest that equal attention should be paid to winter
   survival. One cause of reduced winter survival may be hunting. A model
   incorporating the area specific survival and chick production resulted
   in lambda = 1, when chick production was 1.8 chicks per adult and when
   there was no hunting. The model suggested that grouse could not be
   hunted in four of the 21 years without reducing the population size on
   the island and in many years only a modest harvest could be recommended.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {119-126},
Abstract = {Since the return of the wolverine Gulo gulo to the Snohetta area in
   Norway in 1979, wolverine predation on sheep Ovis aves has increased in
   parallel with increases in the number of sheep. Reducing the predation
   would also reduce the economic losses suffered by sheep farmers and
   could increase their willingness to accept the presence of wolverines in
   the area. Therefore, experiments with volatile repellents to reduce
   predation by wolverines on sheep were carried out. Experiments showed
   that five oils and three pure chemicals gave distinctive avoidance
   reactions by captive wolverines. The release rates of the different
   chemicals were tested in the laboratory and a dispenser allowing the use
   of the chemicals as long-lasting repellents was developed. In 1993, half
   of the ewes and their lambs in areas with high losses due to wolverine
   predation were randomly chosen and fitted with dispensers containing
   these chemicals. In 1994, the test was repeated and the study area was
   expanded to include a nearby area, in which farmers had also suffered
   high wolverine predation on their sheep in recent years. All sheep
   flocks were monitored during the free-ranging grazing period, and when
   carcasses were found, necropsies were performed to ascertain the cause
   of death. Nearly all dispensers were damaged to some degree during the
   grazing period, but because family groups (ewes and their lambs) were
   marked, this is believed to probably not have affected the experiment
   significantly. In spite of the technical failures, significantly fewer
   losses occurred in the groups with dispensers than in the groups without
   dispensers. A better dispenser must be developed and a large-scale test
   should be performed before it is possible to conclude definitively that
   volatile repellents may be used as an operational instrument to reduce
   economic losses to sheep farmers and to help conserve wolverines.},

   J.M. 1996: Body condition and spring migration in female high-arctic
   barnacle geese Branta leucopsis. - Wildl. Biol. 2: 247-251.
   Female barnacle geese Branta leucopsis were studied on their spring
   staging area on the coast of mid-Norway and 1,500 km further to the
   north on their breeding areas in the Arctic archipelago, Svalbard. The
   number of days between departure from their spring staging area and
   arrival on their breeding area ranged between 10 and 33 days. There was
   no significant relationship between the date of departure and the date
   of arrival for individual females (N = 51), indicating that
   early-leaving females were not necessarily the first to arrive at the
   breeding grounds. Late-arriving females were in better body condition
   upon arrival than early-arriving females (N = 25). These data imply that
   the barnacle geese breeding in Svalbard do not migrate directly from
   their traditional spring staging areas to their breeding areas, but
   spend a considerable amount of time, not only resting, but also feeding
   during their migration northwards. This result has important
   implications for the management of the barnacle goose population on
   Svalbard since areas other than their traditional spring staging grounds
   apparently determine the date of arrival at the breeding grounds, body
   reserves at arrival and subsequent reproduction.},

Abstract = {The awareness of the effects of transboundary pollution has increased
   the necessity to use comparable methods and to initiate joint studies
   between countries in environmental monitoring. In freshwater fish
   monitoring a number of different methods have been used, strongly
   reducing the possibilities to comparative assessments between countries.
   In 1990, a workshop on freshwater fish sampling was initiated in order
   to develop and intercalibrate methods used in freshwater fish studies in
   the Nordic countries. During a three year period, a new type of
   multi-mesh gill net to be used for fish monitoring in Norway, Finland
   and Sweden have been developed. Comparative studies and
   gillnet-selectivity assessments show that these new multi-mesh gillnets
   better describe the actual population structure of European perch (Perca
   fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and Arctic char (Salvelinus
   alpinus) than do the traditional giunet series used in the Nordic
   countries. Ageing of fish is central in most environmental studies,
   however, the comparability of analyses performed at different
   laboratories may be low. Comparative age analyses between the three
   countries have been performed for a number of fish species. The results
   of ageing E. perch, whitefish (Coregonus sp.) and roach indicate that
   differences between laboratories can be reduced by intercalibration. In
   the future, the workgroup will be focused on a further development of
   joint methods within studies of freshwater fish and on joint internordic
   assessments on species distribution, abundance and life history
   characteristics in relation to airborne pollutants and liming.},

Abstract = {The Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Long-Range Transported Air
   Pollutants started in 1980. The biological part of this programme
   includes besides invertebrate studies in streams, (i) fish community
   status in lakes by means of interviews, test-fishing in lakes by using
   standard gill-net series, recruitment studies of brown trout in inland
   streams, and juvenile stock assess and monitoring of fish kills in
   salmon rivers. Damaged fish stocks are recognized within a land area of
   51,500 km(2) in southern Norway and 30 km(2) in northern Norway. At
   least 6,000 lake-dwelling fish stocks have either been lost or are at
   various stages of reduction. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) is the most
   widespread and abundant species of fish in Norwegian watersheds, and is
   also most severe affected by acidification. More recently, there are
   some indications of an increase in the abundance of brown trout in some
   areas. However, analysis of age structure in lakes, and fry densities in
   streams in such areas revealed large annual variations in recruitment
   rate, which indicates unstable water chemical conditions. Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar) is virtually extinct in 25 rivers in southernmost
   southwestern and western Norway.},

   of acidification. In 1985, Lake Fjorda was limed in order to improve
   water quality so the fish community would be recovered. Fish stock
   assessment by means of gill-net fishing in the epibenthic and pelagic
   zones was carried out before (1983) and three years after liming
   (1991-1993). Populations of Arctic char and whitefish have not recovered
   after eight years of liming. Brown trout are almost extinct and do not
   seem to be recovering. Perch were less affected by acidification,
   exhibiting good recruitment also before liming.},

Abstract = {The effects of liming on juvenile stock; of Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the river Vikedalselva in
   southwestern Norway were assessed. From 1987 to 1989, the river was
   limed only during the spring snow melt, and pH varied in the range
   between 5.5 and 7.0. In 1990 to 1993, the river was limed to pH 6.2 from
   15 February to 1 June and to pH 5.7 during the rest of the year. Since
   1994, the pH during late winter and spring was maintained above 6.5.
   Prior to liming fish kills were evident during spring snow melt, but
   these have not occurred since liming. Electrofishing in the autumn
   between 1981 and 1994 showed no significant change in densities of
   juvenile salmon and brown trout after liming, mean densities ranged
   between 19-50 and 9-32 individuals 100 m(-2) respectively. A significant
   linear correlation between production and biomass of both species was
   found, indicating that factors directly controlling density affect
   juvenile production and cause production to remain below carrying
   capacity. In spite of a clear increase in pH and a reduction in the
   concentration of labile aluminium after liming, the conditions still do
   not seem to be optimal for juvenile salmonids. We suggest that a
   complexity of different factors impose limitations on fish production in
   the river: inadequate egg deposition, environmental factors such as
   water temperature and dow, osmoregulatory failure in mixing zones
   between limed and acidic water and gill damage through deposition of
   aluminium and iron. However, there are several indications of a
   reduction in toxic effects after the pH was raised to 6.5 during spring
   snow melt.},

Abstract = {The assumptions required to estimate litter size at birth from counts of
   placental scars were experimentally tested in the Arctic fox (Alopex
   lagopus). Effects of abortions were tested by examination of uteri from
   females caused to abort at 20 and 40 days pregnancy. The reliability of
   estimated litter sizes was tested by comparing litter size at 2-3 days
   postpartum with counts of placental scars. Placental scars were
   categorized according to their visibility, with pale and hardly
   detectable scars designated as category 1 and dark and fully pigmented
   scars as category 6. The results showed that scars from abortions and
   scars that persisted for 80 weeks postpartum were paler and less visible
   than scars from full-term fetuses at 20-35 weeks postpartum. Pale scars
   from abortions and scars sustained from earlier pregnancies, therefore,
   should be excluded when estimating litter size at birth. Litter size at
   2-3 days postpartum was not significantly different from estimated
   litter size when pale scars were excluded from the estimates. Our
   results confirmed that breeding females might be distinguished from
   nonbreeders by the visibility of placental scars. The accuracy of this
   approach, however, depends on the frequency of late abortions in the
   population.},

Abstract = {Native and native-stocked brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Lake Tesse, a
   regulated hydroelectric reservoir (southern Norway), were spatially
   segregated according to size: small individuals occurred mainly in the
   epibenthic habitat and larger individuals mainly in the pelagic habitat.
   In contrast, all size groups of non-native stocked brown trout were
   mostly restricted to the epibenthic habitat. Age-specific lengths were
   generally larger for non-native than for native stocked trout, which
   were larger than native fish, However, growth rate between age 3 and 4
   was significantly lower for non-native stocked fish than for native and
   native stocked fish. Differences in body length were mainly due to
   strain but also to some extent to habitat. Native fish had significantly
   fuller stomachs in the pelagic than in the epibenthic habitat in summer.
   Epibenthic non-native fish had significantly fuller stomachs than native
   and native stocked fish in August but not in July. Native and native
   stocked fish fed mainly on surface insects and planktonic crustaceans in
   both habitats. We hypothesize that the non-native brown trout stocked in
   Lake Tesse do not use the pelagic habitat in the home lake and are
   therefore less adapted to utilize such habitat than populations
   originating from lakes where pelagic habitat is available.},

   hatching period, as judged from the drift, was negatively correlated
   with the increase in water discharge (vendace: R(2) = 0.73; whitefish:
   R(2) = 0.68). The length of the egg incubation period and time of
   hatching were not significantly correlated with the ambient water
   temperature. Two artificial floods (220 m(3) . s(-1)), released before
   normal spring flooding, increased the total number of drifting
   Coregoninae larvae in the river. The first flood increased the number of
   vendace and whitefish larvae per second from 2.1 and 0.0 to 86.1 and
   4.5, respectively, before returning to preflood levels. The second flood
   gave 18.9 and 1.8 individuals/s.},

Title = {LOCALIZATION OF A CONTACT ZONE BETWEEN 2 HIGHLY DIVERGENT
   MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA LINEAGES OF THE BROWN BEAR URSUS-ARCTOS IN SCANDINAVIA},

Abstract = {In Europe the brown bear (Ursus arctos) is represented by two different
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages, which probably diverged about 0.85
   million years ago. Scandinavia has been colonized by, representatives of
   both lineages, from the north (eastern lineage) and from the south
   (western lineage), and now bears occur primarily in four main regions
   called female concentration areas. For management purposes the
   localization of the contact zone between these two genotypes is
   important. Using hairs as a source of DNA, 127 individual brown bears
   from throughout the Scandinavian Populations were assayed for lineage
   assignment. A part of the mtDNA control region was amplified via the
   polymerase chain reaction, and the product was either sequenced (14
   individuals) or digested with two diagnostic restriction endonucleases
   (113 individuals). Fifty-six and 71 bears were assigned to the western
   and eastern lineages respectively. The geographic distribution of the
   two genotypes allowed precise localization of the contact zone. Only two
   males from each lineage had crossed the border between the two lineages.
   We used dispersal data from bears radio-marked as yearlings to determine
   whether potential mtDNA introgressions agreed with the dispersal
   behavior of bears. The males in the `'wrong'' areas were all within the
   95th-percentile dispersal distance from the `'correct'' area. Females
   were more philopatric than males, and none were found in the wrong
   areas. The two female concentration areas flanking the contact zone were
   134 km apart. Thus, radiotelemetry results on dispersal distances could
   explain the occurrence of the males in the wrong genetic area. In the
   absence of information concerning possible male-mediated gene flow, a
   conservative management approach would be to consider the southern and
   the three northern female concentration areas as two distinct
   conservation units.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the gill raker structure of planktivorous fish
   (number, distance between gill rakers and length) and selective feeding
   on different species and size classes of zooplankton was studied. Gill
   raker structure was measured for brown trout Salmo trutta, Arctic charr
   Salvelinus alpinus, whitefish Coregonus lavaretus, roach Rutilus
   rutilus, bleak Alburnus alburnus, and three-spined stickleback
   Gasterosteus aculeatus. All species are facultative planktivorous fish
   and occur commonly in Scandinavian lakes. The effect of gill raker
   structure was studied by comparing prey found in fish stomachs with the
   availability of zooplankton from several lakes. Gill raker length and
   distance were significantly correlated with fish length. Although gill
   raker structure differed among species, all fish species selected the
   larger zooplankters. The minimum size of cladoceran species found in
   fish stomachs was much smaller than the distance between gill rakers.
   Despite great differences in gill raker spacing, the minimum size
   ingested of Daphnia galeata and Bosmina longispina was similar for all
   predators. The hypothesis that small zooplankton are strained and
   retained by the gill rakers in particulate feeding planktivorous fish,
   particularly in salmonids and roach, is rejected. (C) 1995 The Fisheries

Journal = {VEGETATIO},

Abstract = {The distribution and abundance of Thelypteris limbosperma, Athyrium
   distentifolium, and Matteuccia struthiopteris are modelled statistically
   in relation to 14 environmental variables along the major climatic,
   topographic, and edaphic gradients in western Norway. The data are from
   624 stands from which measurements or estimates of mean January and mean
   July temperatures, humidity, altitude, aspect, and slope are available.
   From 182 of these stands eight soil variables have also been measured.
   The species responses are quantified by two numerical methods: Gaussian
   legit regression and weighted averaging (WA) regression. The estimated
   WA optima suggest that A. distentifolium has an ecological preference
   for low July and January temperatures, high altitudes, and soils of
   low-medium pH and base content. The species shows statistically
   significant Gaussian responses with summer temperature, humidity (=
   Martonnes humidity index), altitude, slope, aspect, pH, cation exchange
   capacity, and base saturation with optima of 8.7 degrees C, 188.9, 1220
   m, 28 degrees, 29 degrees, 4.8, 13.77 mEq 100 g dry soil(-1), and
   13.4\%, respectively. These suggest that the occurrence and relative
   abundance of A. distentifolium are well predicted by summer temperature,
   topography, and soil pH and base status. T. limbosperma has WA optima
   that suggest that it favours moderately high winter and summer
   temperatures, high humidity, medium altitude, and soils of low pH and
   base content. It has significant Gaussian responses to summer
   temperature (optimum = 12.6 degrees C), winter temperature (-1.8 degrees
   C), humidity (179.2), altitude (459.5 m), slope (22.5 degrees), and Na
   (0.7 mg 100 g dry soil(-1)). These suggest that climatic factors,
   altitude, and slope are significant predictors for its occurrence and
   abundance. M. struthiopteris has high WA optima for summer temperature,
   pH, Ca, Mg, K, Na, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and base saturation,
   and a low optima for humidity and winter temperature. Of these, summer
   temperature (16.0 degrees C), Ca (63.1 mg 100 g dry soil(-1)), Mg (41.0
   mg 100 g dry soil(-1)), K (23.6 mg 100 g dry soil(-1)), Na (5.0 mg 100 g
   dry soil(-1)), CEC (60.7 mEq 100 g dry soil(-1)), and base saturation
   (56.3\%) have significant Gaussian legit responses, as do aspect (150.2
   degrees) and loss-on-ignition (9.4\%). These results suggest that the
   occurrence and relative abundance of M. struthiopteris are well
   predicted by high soil base cations, a generally southern aspect, low
   organic content in the soil, and high July temperatures.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of matrix on the

   study was conducted in two kinds of landscape: (1) an agricultural
   landscape, where the censused forest habitat fragments were surrounded
   by farmland, and (2) in an intensively managed forested landscape, where
   the censused habitat fragments were surrounded by nonhabitat coniferous
   forest. Occupied and unoccupied habitat fragments in the agricultural
   landscape differed significantly in distance to the nearest suitable
   continuous habitat, with hazel grouse occurring only in habitat
   fragments closer than 100 m from continuous forest. In the intensively
   managed forest landscape, the effect of isolation was less evident, but
   there might be a threshold around 2 km. Effects of isolation occurred
   over much shorter distances when the surrounding habitats consisted of
   farmland than when it was forested habitats. The size of the habitat
   fragments was important in both landscapes, with larger habitat
   fragments more often containing hazel grouse.},

   incubating large clutches lost more mass and had a lower body condition
   at day 20 in the incubation period than females incubating small
   clutches. Females incubating large clutches had a slightly shorter
   incubation period and a lower egg predation rate. The results do not
   support the hypothesis that the female's ability to produce eggs is the
   only ultimate control of clutch size in elder Instead the results
   suggest that there may be an interaction between the allocation of body
   reserves to eggs and incubation, and that females producing large
   clutches allocate more of their body reserves to incubation than females
   producing small clutches, in order to shorten the incubation period and
   to minimise the risk of predation on eggs.},

Abstract = {The ascent of brown trout spawners (Salmo trutta L.) in the fish ladder
   at the Hunder dam on the River Gudbrandsdalslagen, eastern Norway was
   correlated with water flow and water temperature from 1983 to 1990.
   Ascent took place from the end of June to the middle of October. The
   majority of the trout entered the fishway during August and the first
   half of September. Before arriving at the fish ladder, ascending trout
   must pass through two sections of river with differing flow regimes and
   optimum flows for migration Conditions in the section below the dam are
   critical for ascent. When discharge over the dam exceeded about 180 m(3)
   s(-1), it was difficult for the fish to locate the entrance to the
   fishway. High discharges often occurred in June and July, delaying or
   preventing ascent. At flows below 20 m(3) s(-1) it was difficult for
   fish larger than 80 cm to approach the ladder entrance. When flow
   decreased to below 10 m(3) s(-1), ascent was difficult for all sizes.
   Water temperature was of less importance. Lengths of brown trout
   ascending the ladder were most often between 55 and 75 cm. Large fish
   arrived earlier than small fish, females before males, and naturally
   recruited fish before stacked fish.},

Title = {THE EFFECT OF MATING PROBABILITY ON RISK-TAKING - AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY

Abstract = {We model the relationship between mating probability and risk taking for
   lekking animals disturbed by predators. Our dynamic model is based on
   different mating probabilities among the lekking males and a decline in
   both predation risk and mating probability with hiding time after a
   predator attack at the lek. The model predicts that a lekking male with
   low expected mating probability should hide for a longer period after a
   predator attack than a male with high mating probability. It also
   predicts that males should hide for a longer period when predation risk
   is high and that a high mating advantage of a rapid return after an
   attack reduces the differences in optimal hiding time among males with
   different mating probabilities. To test the first prediction from the
   model, we have flushed great snipe (Gallinago media) males from leks and
   compared their hiding times to their temporary expected mating
   probabilities. As predicted by our model, males with the highest
   expected probabilities of mating had the shortest hiding times.
   Empirical data also showed that individuals adjusted their hiding time
   to temporary changes in their probability of mating. Such plasticity in
   mating behavior may reduce differences among males in lifetime
   reproductive success and thus also reduce the intensity of sexual
   selection.},

Abstract = {The costs of reproduction in Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla were studied
   from 1990 to 1993 on Hornoy in northern Norway by enlarging and
   decreasing brood sizes of two chicks to three and one during the first
   week after hatching. No parents were able to raise the enlarged broods
   of three to fledging. Most chick mortality occurred in the 19-22 d age
   group. Chick body mass and fledging success were lower among enlarged
   broods than among reduced and control broods. Body mass of females, but
   not males, was lower at the end of the chick-rearing period in enlarged
   broods. Only those females rearing enlarged broods experienced a higher
   mortality during the next breeding season. Our results support Lack's
   hypothesis of clutch size regulation: Kittiwakes laid the maximal number
   of eggs they were able to raise successfully to hedging. Furthermore, as
   female Kittiwake mortality increased when clutches were enlarged,
   females have a trade-off between investment in current reproduction and
   investment in future reproduction. Because males and females responded
   differently to brood enlargement, fitness estimates showed that
   Kittiwakes may have a sex-specific optimal clutch size.},

   found in the areas closest to the smelters. In this study, there is
   evidence for a direct link between increased metal concentrations in
   wild animals and pollution from the Russian smelters for Cu and Ni and
   to some extent for Cr. relatively high concentration of Hg and slight
   increases in Pb are also documented, but regional differences within

Abstract = {Antarctic Petrel Thalassoica antarctica incubation and brooding effort
   was studied at Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, during the austral
   summer of 1991-1992. The females probably left the nest site shortly
   after egg laying. The duration of incubation and brooding shifts as well
   as the daily weight loss (absolute and proportionate) were comparable
   with those of other similar-sized procellariform species. Males spent
   more time incubating and brooding than did females, suggesting higher
   female energy stress due to egg laying, Incubating birds which were
   below average weight were likely to desert the nests before their mates
   returned from feeding trips. Both males and females lost approximately
   one-fifth of their body-weight during their first incubation shifts.
   Nevertheless, they increased their initial weights from egg laying to
   hatching and had their highest initial weights when they returned to
   start the shift during which the egg hatched. No factors related to
   adult body-weight explained the duration of the incubation shifts, Both
   males and females gained weight at a higher rate when at sea than they
   lost it during incubation, and it is suggested that factors unrelated to
   food availability or individual feeding skills may be important in
   regulating the duration of the incubation shifts and the stay at sea.},

Abstract = {We report a distinct terrain structure in high-use portions of reindeer

   portions of wintering areas. Terrain ruggedness was found to be
   significantly higher in high-use areas. Indices of terrain ruggedness
   reflecting fine-scale features (10-20 m) corresponded well with the
   availability of potential feeding sites (< 40 cm snow depth), while
   contour densities alone did not. Terrain structure should be considered
   an important habitat attribute for management planning on reindeer
   winter habitats. The index provides a simple method for quantifying
   differences in fine-scale ruggedness between habitats.},

Abstract = {Optimal harvesting theories based on the concept of maximum sustained
   yield assume a stationary distribution of population size, ignoring that
   extinction is the eventual fate of all populations. We analyze the
   dynamics of populations at risk of extinction from demographic and
   environmental stochasticity as well as harvesting. Diffusion theory is
   used to derive approximate formulas for the mean time to extinction, T,
   the expected cumulative harvest before extinction, Y, and the mean and
   standard deviation of annual harvest, (\$) over bar y and sigma(y). In
   numerical examples we compare the performance of different harvesting
   strategies in terms of these statistics. We derive optimal harvesting
   strategies that maximize Y or (\$) over bar y. The optimal strategies
   always involve a threshold function in which harvesting occurs at the
   maximum possible rate above a critical population size, c, with no
   harvest below c. For a broad class of stochastic population models we
   show that Y is maximized, with unlimited harvesting capability, when the
   critical size equals the carrying capacity of the population (c = K),
   and with limited harvesting capability when c < K. Optimizing (\$) over
   bar y produces a smaller value of c than optimizing Y. We also derive
   the optimal strategy that maximizes Y subject to a prescribed risk of
   extinction.},

Title = {SOURCES OF VARIATION IN RADIOCESIUM LEVELS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL FISH FROM
   A CHERNOBYL CONTAMINATED NORWEGIAN LAKE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {352-361},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {1. We evaluate sources of individual variation in Cs-137 Of Arctic charr
   (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) from a Norwegian
   lake contaminated by fall-out from the Chernobyl accident. Samples were
   collected on 14 occasions between July 1986 and October 1989.
   2. The relationship between Cs-137 concentration, and fish weight, age
   and growth rate, changed with time. In 1986 the Cs-137 concentration in
   Arctic charr was negatively correlated with age and positively
   correlated with growth rate. Later, after a transition period, Cs-137
   concentration in Arctic charr became positively correlated with weight
   and age, and negatively correlated with growth rate. The timing of this
   change was associated with changes in prey relative to fish
   radioactivity.
   3. From September 1987 and throughout the study, the increase in Cs-137
   concentration with fish weight could be described by a power-function
   with weight exponents of 0.39 and 0.11 for Arctic charr and brown trout,
   respectively. We could detect no diet changes with size in brown trout,
   while Arctic charr showed a diet shift from zooplankton to zoobenthos
   with increasing age and weight. This diet shift probably accounted for
   the larger increase in Cs-137 concentration with weight in charr than
   trout.
   4. Variation in fish weight accounted for 29 and 11\% of the individual
   variation in Cs-137 concentration in Arctic charr and brown trout,
   respectively. Most of the variation in caesium concentrations can be
   attributed to size independent factors, of which individual variation in
   diet composition is suggested to be the most important one.
   5. Frequency distributions of Cs-137 concentration in fish were
   positively skewed, leptokurtic and differed significantly from the
   normal distribution, but not from the log-normal distribution.
   Individual variation in caesium concentration was rather large, and
   larger in Arctic charr than in brown trout, probably because of a wider
   niche utilization by Arctic charr than by brown trout. These large
   individual variations necessitate large sample sizes if representative
   values of Cs-137 concentration for the populations shall be obtained.},

Abstract = {Ydenberg proposed that nomadic predators are responsible for the
   observed geographical synchrony in microtine population dynamics in
   Fennoscandia. I tested this hypothesis by studying an alpine assemblage
   of microtine species being out of phase with the neighboring areas by
   using mortality-collars and mark-recapture trapping.
   The studied population failed to increase during the summer although the
   females were breeding continuously. Predators caused a 82\% mortality
   rate (25 of the 26 observed deaths) during summer among the adults,
   which is sufficient to synchronize otherwise asynchronous populations.
   Young root voles had lower persistence than adult root voles in the
   start of the summer but this trend was reversed in the latter part of
   the summer. Persistence of young voles was significant negatively
   correlated with the observed dispersal rates of the adults. Adult
   dispersal occurred only in the first part of the summer. Survival rates
   of young root voles were not significantly correlated with the observed
   survival rates of the mortality-collared adults. Hence, the very low
   apparent survival (persistence) of young root voles early in the summer

Abstract = {Increasing interest in combining agricultural and nature conservation
   goals has focused on the potential beneficial role of remnant biotopes
   on farmland.  This study examines the role of field boundaries and a
   small habitat island within cereal fields in providing a source of
   forage for bumblebees (Bombus Latr.), throughout one season.  Transect
   techniques were used to assess bumblebee use of common types of boundary
   vegetation between crops and semi-natural habitats, and along a footpath
   within a small woodlot, in southeastern Norway.  There were seven
   species of bumblebee in these habitats, which used only a small fraction
   of the total number of flowering plant species available to any extent;
   only nine out of a total of 78 flowering plant species received more
   than five visits.  All bumblebee species had a preference for perennial
   herbs as forage resources.  The quantity of floral resources, their
   spatial pattern and temporal constancy varied among sites with the least
   disturbed and open habitats being of greatest value to bumblebees. 
   Length of field boundary and single date surveys are poor indices of the
   value of field boundaries to bumblebees.},

Abstract = {In polygynous and sexually dimorphic mammals, parents may be expected to
   bias their investment towards sons because variation in reproductive
   success is usually higher among males than among females. Moreover, male
   reproductive success often depends on adult body size, which, in turn,
   may depend on the level of parental investment. We therefore predicted
   that in the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), a polygynous and sexually
   dimorphic phocid seal, females should invest more in individual sons
   than in individual daughters. We found that male pups were born heavier
   than female pups, but that the growth rates and suckling behaviour were
   similar for the two sexes. The growth rates and the birth weights were
   not correlated for the pups of either sex. Mothers did not behave
   differentially towards offspring of the two sexes, except that mothers
   of male pups spent more time in visual contact with their pups. Male and
   female pups had similar activity levels and begged at similar rates. We
   argue that reports of equal expenditure on the two sexes can be accepted
   as evidence of equal investment, provided that three assumptions are
   fulfilled. First, parental care must be costly to the parent. Second,
   energy expenditure must be the most important component of parental
   investment. Third, there must be no negative correlation between
   maternal body condition and the ratio of sons to daughters produced. We
   argue that these assumptions are met in our study, and that our results
   provide evidence of equal maternal investment in the sexes in grey
   seals.},

Abstract = {Flock size, food abundance and dispersion patterns, and cover at
   foraging sites were determined in winter for Hazel Grouse Bonasa bonasia
   at three study areas near the eastern edge of the species' range in
   eastern Siberia and one near the western edge in Sweden. Winter group
   size varied by habitat type; least in dense spruce forests in Sweden,
   when Hazel Grouse defended winter territories; intermediate in
   larch-birch ecotonal forests in Siberia; and greatest in open deciduous
   riparian forests in Siberia, where they formed cohesive, sexually mixed
   flocks. Group size in winter increased with increasingly open forests
   that had less cover at arboreal foraging sites but more winter food
   available, suggesting that the previously reported geographical
   differences in winter group size actually reflect habitat differences. A
   literature review supported this view. Winter food trees were
   significantly more abundant and more evenly distributed in the Siberian
   habitats than in the Swedish habitat. We suggest that groups were larger
   in more open habitats as a response to higher predation risk, but that
   food abundance also influences social organization. For example,
   abundant food may be a prerequisite for flocking behavior to originate.
   We present a conceptual model that can be used to test our hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Observations of sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (O. F.

   initiated a more extensive survey of sea urchin and kelp Laminaria
   hyperborea (Gunn.) Foslie forest distribution along 700 km of coastline.
   Records of the distribution and prevalence of the nematode
   Echinomermella matsi Jones and Hagen, 1987, an endoparasite of S.
   droebachiensis, were also included as the parasite has been postulated
   to cause sea urchin mass mortality. Sampling was concentrated in 5 areas
   of coastline along mid and northern Norway. Each area was studied along
   a wave exposure gradient. Old kelp forests have persisted along the
   outermost exposed parts of the coastline despite the 20 yr population
   outbreak of sea urchins. Inshore of the exposed kelp zone and towards
   the mainland, sea urchin dominated barren grounds still persisted. The
   distribution and abundance of S. droebachiensis in the southernmost area
   (Froya) was greatly reduced, and expansion of kelp into former barren
   grounds resulted. Reduced numbers of sea urchins and some macroalgal
   regrowth also occurred in the 2 central areas 140 and 280 km north of
   Froya, whilst high population densities of small sized S. droebachiensis
   on `barrens' still dominated the inner zone in the 2 northern areas. The
   study indicated that S. droebachiensis populations, and hence the barren
   ground state, may be in a labile phase along the southern 300 km of the
   coast, whilst its slate in the northern areas seems more persistent thus
   far. E. matsi was not found in the southernmost area. S. droebachiensis
   was heavily infested in the 2 central areas. In northern areas E. matsi
   was found only at a few sites. The pattern of parasite occurrence and
   sea urchin regression makes the role of E. matsi in this process
   questionable and indicates that 1 or more unidentified waterborne agents
   have been involved.},

Abstract = {Invertebrates move in the agricultural landscape at a range of spatial
   scales. These movements may be seasonal events or induced by farming
   activities such as cultivation, pesticide application etc. The animals'
   activity may take them across field boundaries, which may represent
   impediments to such movement, especially for non-flying arthropods. In
   this work, marked predatory carabid beetles (Harpalus rufipes,
   Pterostichus melanarius and Pterostichus madidus) were released within
   polythene-walled areas that traversed either a hedgerow or were located
   within a barley field. The rate of recapture of the beetles at the
   opposite end of the experimental areas was recorded for up to 25 days
   following release. Recapture rates reached 100\% in some cases but
   movement was markedly slowed in the hedgerow treatment compared with the
   barley field control. There were also effects of beetle starvation and
   sex. Starvation prior to release resulted in a more rapid crossing of
   the boundary, especially for P. melanrius (both sexes) and H. rufipes
   females. Results are compared with other studies on the role of
   landscape features in slowing insect dispersal, involving groups such as
   Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera},

Abstract = {In 1989, a number of glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) were found dead
   near a seabird cliff at south Svalbard. In an effort to elucidate the
   course of death, 12 individuals were sent to the Central Veterinary
   Institute for autopsy and analysis of chlorinated pesticides and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in samples of liver, kidney, brain and
   muscle. Eggs of common and Brunnich's guillemots constitute important
   food for glaucous gulls during the nestling period, thus 13 eggs (3 eggs
   from common and 10 eggs from Brunnich's guillemots) from the same area
   were also analyzed for organochlorines. The autopsy of the birds did not
   reveal any specific cause of death. The following chlorinated pesticides
   were analyzed: hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (alpha-,
   beta-, gamma-HCH), chlordanes (oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, heptachlor
   and heptachlor epoxide), the drin group (aldrin, dieldrin) and the DDT
   group (o,p', p,p'DDT, DDD and DDE). Relatively low hepatic
   concentrations of dieldrin were found (n.d.-0.17 mg/kg wet weight
   (w.w.), mean 0.04), Sigma HCH (n.d.-0.14 mg/kg w.w., mean 0.02), HCB
   (0.03-1.01 mg/kg w.w., mean 0.51), oxychlordane (0.01-1.85 mg/kg w.w.,
   mean 1.05), p,p'DDE (0.81-5.41 mg/kg w.w., mean 2.98), o,p'DDD (0-0.52
   mg/kg w.w., mean 0.14) and Sigma DDT (0.9-6.25 mg/kg w.w., mean 2.92).
   Levels of the other chlorinated pesticides were below the quantification
   level. Very high concentrations of PCBs were found. The Sigma PCB (sum
   of wet weight concentrations of the 21 individual congeners, the IUPAC
   nos. 28, 52, 74, 99, 101, 110, 118, 114, 153, 105, 141, 138, 183, 128,
   187, 156, 157, 180, 170, 194 and 209) in hepatic tissue was 0.8-32.3
   mg/kg w.w. (mean 16.0), in brain 0.9-29.5 mg/kg w.w. (mean 14.8), in
   kidney 0.4-21.4 mg/kg w.w. (mean 9.7) and in muscle 0.5-6.0 mg/kg w.w.
   (mean 3.1). The concentrations of the individual PCB congeners are also
   given. Relatively low concentrations of all the organochlorines were
   found in guillemot eggs, mean concentrations of Sigma DDT and PCBs were
   0.25 and 0.47 mg/kg w.w., respectively. A toxicological evaluation of
   the PCB results is difficult; however, it cannot be excluded that PCBs
   might have contributed to the death of the gulls.},

Abstract = {This study presents preliminary results on the levels of organochlorines
   (OCs) in three seabird species: common eider (Somateria mollissima),
   kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) from
   the Barents Sea area, including Frans Josef Land, Ny-Alesund, Bjormoya
   and Horrnoya, in July-August, 1991. Kittiwake was the only species
   collected at all four sampling areas, and all three species were sampled
   only at Ny-Alesund. Samples of liver, fat, muscle and brain tissue were
   analyzed for chlorinated pesticides, hexachlorobenzene (HCB),
   hexachlorocyclohexanes (alpha,beta,gamma-HCH), chlordanes (oxychlordane,
   trans-nonachlor and heptachlor epoxide), the DDT group (op', pp'DDT, DDD
   and DDE) and the industrial chemical polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
   In all species, the highest OC levels were found in fat tissue, followed
   by liver, muscle and brain. PCBs were the major OC contaminants,
   followed by the DDT group, the chlordane group, HCB and the HCHs. Only
   low levels of HCHs were found. The lowest mean level of Sigma PCB - sum
   of concentrations of the 19 individual congeners (2.8 mu g/kg wet weight
   (w.w.)) - was found in the liver of juvenile common eider from Frans
   Josef Land. The highest mean level of Sigma PCB (15 980 mu g/kg w.w.)
   was found in the fat of adult glaucous gulls from Ny-Alesund. There were
   no significant geographical trends in OC contamination in the species
   investigated. However, the OC levels in kittiwake were highest at
   Bjornoya. The OC contamination levels in seabirds from the Barents Sea
   region are in general lower in the 1990s than in past decades.},

Abstract = {Mate sampling by great snipe, Gallinago media, was studied by following
   individually marked females on their visits to two leks in five
   consecutive mating seasons. The main objectives were to determine
   whether the females used a sequential search or a best-of-N-males
   comparison when selecting a mating partner, and to evaluate the
   consequences of females engaging in copulations with more than one male
   and in repeated copulations with the same male. The minimum length of
   the period between the first observation of a female and her first
   observed copulation varied from 0 to 18 days (median 4). One to 10 males
   (median=2) were visited in the pre-mating period. Nineteen females
   (58\%) mated on their first observed visit to the territory of a male,
   whereas 14 (42\%) returned to a previously visited male to mate. Seven
   (21\%) of the females were seen copulating on more than one night, and
   four of them changed copulation partner between nights. The fact that so
   many females were seen returning to a previously visited male to mate is
   best explained by a best-of-N-males comparison, but the results could
   also be explained by a sequential search strategy with a variable
   threshold. Females copulated more with successful males and they
   copulated more when other females were present on the territory of the
   male than when alone. Competition between females is most likely to
   account for these differences, but the mechanism is not known. The
   testes of great snipe males were large compared with those of other
   waders, indicating that sperm competition is important in this lekking
   species.},

Abstract = {Early in the 20th century, the badger was permanently established
   throughout southern Scandinavia (except the island of Gotland), and
   scattered populations were thought to occur up to approximately 63
   degrees N (Collet 1911-1912, Ekman 1922). That was also the situation in
   the early 1940's. However, 40 years later individual badgers were
   reported beyond the Arctic Circle up to 67 degrees N in Sweden and 68
   degrees N in Norway (Bevanger 1985), i.e. another 300 km northwards.
   Questionnaires completed by regional and local wildlife boards showed
   that the range of permanent distribution now extends along the Baltic
   coast to the inner part of the Gulf of Bothnia in Sweden, and through
   coastal and inland areas up to 65 degrees N in Norway. Here, we discuss
   the possible causes of this expansion, such as climate, predators and
   human impact.},

Abstract = {The American mink Mustela vison is widely distributed in several
   European countries, mainly as a result of the escape of animals from
   mink farms. In 1985, an analysis of Norwegian mink farming history
   (Bevanger and Albu 1986a) revealed an excellent correlation between the
   development of mink farming and the dispersal of feral mink populations
   in the wild. Up to 1950, mink mainly existed as rather isolated
   populations in areas where there had been or still were mink farms, but
   they colonized most of the country in the 1950's and 1960's. Based on
   questionnaires and other sources of information, the 1985 investigation
   concluded that only some islands off the coast of central and northern
   Norway, together with the greater part of Finnmark, were mink-free. In
   1993, a questionnaire was sent to every local authority in Troms and
   Finnmark asking whether mink had been observed. All 25 authorities in
   Troms and 18 of the 19 in Finnmark confirmed that there were mink
   populations in their area. The only one reporting no mink populations
   was Hasvik, which is completely devoid of mainland territory. It is
   concluded that the Norwegian mainland has now been fully colonized and
   that only some island areas are mink-free.},

Abstract = {We pursued the hypothesis that pine martens (Martes martes L.) suffer
   from intraguild predation by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.). An increase
   in population density of pine martens in Scandinavia was observed
   concomitant with a decline in the number of foxes due to an epizootic of
   sarcoptic mange during the 1980s. The increase was noted both as numbers
   of crossing marten tracks on snow along transects in a local area, and
   as number of martens harvested in Sweden. The latter could be linked
   county-wise by timing and amplitude to the occurrence of mange and
   decline in number of foxes harvested. We also compiled 16 cases of
   casually observed predation by red foxes on martens, and calculated a
   yearly mortality rate due to fox predation of 0.13 from >14 transmitter
   years of 26 radio-collared martens in three areas of Scandinavia during
   the period of high marten numbers. We conclude that the case against the
   fox is strong.},

   PHALACROCORAX-CARBO-CARBO BREEDING ON THE ATLANTIC COAST OF EUROPE},
Journal = {ARDEA},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-59},
Abstract = {About 37 000 pairs of Cormorants currently breed on the North Atlantic
   coasts of western Europe (France, Britain, Ireland and Norway)
   representing about 83\% of the world population of the nominate form of
   the species. Colonies typically number 10-500 pairs, with a maximum of
   1400 pairs and, with one or two exceptions, occur almost wherever there
   is suitable habitat. The preferred breeding sites are cliffs, stacks and
   rocky offshore islands though some, notably in Ireland, breed in trees.
   Amongst the factors which determine colony size the extent of suitable
   feeding areas (water less than 10 m deep) within 30 km of the colony and
   the proximity of other colonies are shown to be particularly important.
   The general trend in population numbers in the past 10-20 years has been
   upward, probably as a result of increased protection both through
   legislation and by the establishment of safe havens such as nature
   reserves. Rates of increase vary somewhat from area to area but have
   typically averaged a few percent per annum. The only area where declines
   continue is northern Scotland. Two cases of sudden decreases in breeding
   numbers are described (in Norway in 1985-87 and in SW Wales in 1991).
   Both appear to have been due to periods of adverse weather at the
   pre-breeding or early breeding stages acting to keep fish stocks in
   deeper water where Cormorants could not catch them, perhaps coupled in
   the former case by reductions in fish stocks.},

   corroborating the results of a preview enzyme electrophoretic study
   (Hindar et al., 1986 Biol. J. Linn. Soc., 27, 269-85) which suggested
   that the two chan morphs represent sympatric populations with a
   restricted amount of gene flow between them. Both morphs showed a
   positive correlation between year-class strength and minimum pH in
   spring/summer of that year, hence both morphs appeared to be affected by
   acidification. If is suggested that addition of limestone to the
   spawning substrate used by charr may be one way to protect the unique
   genetic and ecological variability of Arctic charr in this lake.},

   3.7-65.3 and 3.2-45.0 mu g g(-1) lipid weight, respectively. The range
   of mean concentrations of dieldrin, endrin and trans-nonachlor was 1-3
   mu g g(-1), while mean concentrations of HCHs, heptachlor epoxide, and
   HCB were <1 mu g g(-1). No significant variation in PCB congener pattern
   was apparent between geographical areas. The major PCB congeners nos
   147/123, 153, 138/163/164, 182/187 and 180 at Gilleleje, Vestlandet and
   Tufjord represented 53\%, 45\% and 44\% of Sigma PCB, respectively. A
   significant difference was found between the number of PCB congeners in
   blubber of newborn and older porpoises. This might indicate the presence
   of a blood/placenta barrier and/or selective mammary transport of PCBs
   with specific structures. A significant OC accumulation with age was
   apparent, with the exception of HCB and HCHs. Geographical differences
   in the levels of OCs were apparent for all compounds except for dieldrin
   and heptachlor epoxide. Significantly higher levels of chlordane
   metabolites (trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane) and endrin were found in
   the group of animals fi om the northern location Tufjord, while Sigma
   DDT, p,p'-DDTs, HCHs and PCBs were highest in the group of animals from
   the southern location Gilleleje. Highest levels of the o,p'-substituted
   DDTs were found in specimens from the middle location Vestlander. These
   findings indicate little or no regular migration of harbour porpoise
   between these three locations. No correlations were found between OC
   concentrations and blubber thickness. Although mean values of Sigma DDT
   and Sigma PCB were in the lower end of previously reported levels in
   harbour porpoise from adjacent waters in the eastern part of the North
   Atlantic Ocean and along the coasts of North America, these levels are
   relatively high.
   The organochlorine concentrations in harbour porpoises in the present
   study were 2-3 times higher than corresponding OC levels detected in
   harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) from the same areas.},

Abstract = {One- and two-year-old hatchery reared juveniles of seven freshwater
   resident and anadromous populations of Scandinavian brown trout were
   released in the outer and inner part of the Oslofjord and in the River
   Akerselva, flowing through the city of Oslo. Recapture rates were
   highest (mean 20.3\%) for river released fish and lowest for those
   released in the outer (16.8\%) and inner (12.1\%) fjord. In general,
   recapture rate increased with fish size at release (r=0.76). When
   released in fresh water, most of the recaptures were from fresh water
   and when released in the fjord, most recaptures were from the fjord. In
   general, freshwater resident stocks showed a higher degree of freshwater
   residency than anadromous stocks. However, mean migratory distance was
   longer for freshwater resident than anadromous fish. Trout moved longer
   distances at sea when released in the outer than in the inner fjord.
   Specific growth rate and size at recapture varied among release sites
   and stocks; they were highest for fish released in the outer fjord and
   lowest for river-released trout. There was no consistent difference in
   sea growth between freshwater resident and anadromous stocks. Estimated
   total yield was highest for fish released in the outer fjord whereas
   there was no significant difference in yields between trout released in

Pages = {243-250},
Abstract = {The area of species-rich hay meadows in Norway has been drastically
   reduced during the 20th century. This continuing process results in
   fragmentation and isolation of remaining habitats. Small and isolated
   populations may have reduced gene flow. This is a crucial factor for the
   structure and cohesiveness of populations. Gene flow in plant species is
   regulated by pollen and seed dispersal, and pollen dispersal is
   controlled by the species' mating system. As part of a research project
   on habitat fragmentation three meadow species (Dactylorhiza sambucina,
   Hypochoeris maculata, Polygala vulgaris) with different life strategies
   were therefore selected for studies of their mating systems. A hand
   pollination experiment showed that both Dactylorhiza sambucina and
   Polygala vulgaris were self-compatible. Seed set in H. maculata was low
   and the species may be considered as pseudo-self-compatible or
   self-incompatible. Using Bawa's (1974) criteria, however, also
   Hypochoeris maculata should be considered as self-compatible. All three
   species enhanced outbreeding but P. vulgaris also proved to be a good
   selfer and autogamous.},

Title = {In situ experiments on recolonization of intertidal mudflat fauna to
   sediment contaminated with different concentrations of oil},
Journal = {SARSIA},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Pages = {175-185},
Abstract = {Field experiments to test the recolonization response of intertidal
   mudflat fauna to oil (North Sea crude) contaminated sediment, were
   performed in experimental boxes on a mudflat in Norway. The oil was
   added in five different concentrations (100, 400, 1000, 4000, 10000 ppm
   wet weight oil in sediment). The oil content persisted at about the same
   level in each treatment throughout the experimental period of 4.5
   months. Concentrations above 1000 ppm oil resulted in a reduction in
   redox-potentials in the sediments. This indirect effect of oil was
   probably responsible for the observed decline in abundance of the deeper
   burrowing species. All the most common species were present in all
   treatments, but most species showed decreasing densities with increasing
   oil concentrations. The tolerance to the oiled conditions was different
   among the different species. Among the meiofauna, and especially for
   ostracods, significant effects were found at 400 ppm and higher, while
   effects on macrofauna were most pronounced above 1000 ppm. However, not
   only tolerance to oil, but differences in exposure to the oiled sediment
   due to differences in behaviour or distributional patterns seems to be
   of importance for the species response to the oiled sediment. Although
   most of the species were found to recolonize defaunated mudflat areas
   within a short time, our results indicate that an oil spill will cause
   prolonged effects to this mudflat community structure due to high
   persistence of oil in sediment and that a few of the most abundant
   species have low tolerance to oil or very low dispersal.},

Title = {The near extinction and recovery of brown bears in Scandinavia in
   relation to the bear management policies of Norway and Sweden},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-25},
Abstract = {Records of bountied brown bears Ursus arctos in Norway and Sweden were
   analysed to estimate population size in the mid-1800's, and changes in
   population size and distribution in relation to the bear management
   policies of both countries. In the mid-1800's about 65\% of the bears in
   Scandinavia were in Norway (perhaps 3,100 in Norway and 1,650 in
   Sweden). Both countries tried to eliminate the bear in the 1800's;
   Sweden was more effective. By the turn of the century, the numbers of
   bears were low in both countries. The lowest population level in the
   population remnants that have subsequently survived occurred around 1930
   and was estimated at 130 bears. Sweden's policy was changed at the turn
   of the century to save the bear from extinction. This policy was
   successful, and the population is now large and expanding. Norway did
   not change its policy and bears were virtually eliminated by 1920-30.
   Since 1975, bear observations increased in Norway. This coincided
   temporally with an abrupt increase in the Swedish bear population, and
   bears reappeared sooner in areas closer to the remnant Swedish
   populations. Both conditions support our conclusion that the bear was
   virtually exterminated in Norway and suggest that bears observed now are
   primarily immigrants from Sweden, except for far northern Norway, which
   was recolonised from Russia and Finland. Today, we estimate that the
   Scandinavian bear population numbers about 700, with about 2\% in Norway
   (on average about 14 in Norway, 650-700 in Sweden). This is a drastic
   reduction in the estimate of bears in Norway, compared with earlier
   studies. The trends in bear numbers responded to the policies in effect.
   The most effective measures used in Scandinavia to conserve bears were
   those that reduced or eliminated the economic incentive for people to
   kill them. Our analysis also suggests that population estimates based on
   reports from observations made by the general public can be greatly
   inflated.},

Abstract = {Landa, A. \& Skogland, T.dagger 1995: The relationship between
   population density and body size of wolverines Gulo gulo in Scandinavia.
   - Wildl. Biol. 1: 165-175. The number of wolverines Gulo gulo in
   Scandinavia has declined dramatically since the middle of the last
   century, and the numbers killed continued to decrease until the species
   was protected. In 1968 the species was protected in Sweden; in 1973 the
   wolverine was given full protection in southern Norway and protection
   during the breeding period in northern Norway; and in 1982 the species
   was also given full protection in northern Norway. The protection has
   resulted in some increase in number, but the population density remains
   much lower than at the turn of the century, and the wolverine has yet
   not reoccupied all of its former range. Our analyses show that body
   size, as reflected by skull characters, was inversely correlated with
   population density from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-to late twentieth
   century. In contrast we found a strong decline in body size in the
   decades after ca 1960. The unexpectedly low wolverine resilience in this
   century may be explained by an energy-restricted model whose main
   factors include: 1) habitat fragmentation, 2) loss of habitat, 3)
   extinction of the dominant predator, the wolf Canis lupus, and 4) a
   maximised turnover in managed ungulate populations that has resulted in
   less natural mortality and fewer weakened animals available for
   scavengers and less efficient predators like the wolverine.},

Title = {Who killed Bambi? The role of predation in the neonatal mortality of
   temperate ungulates},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Pages = {209-223},
Abstract = {A total of 111 papers and reports, coming from 79 major studies and 19
   other studies, on neonatal (first summer) mortality of 10 species of
   northern, temperate ungulates were reviewed. To avoid biases from
   indirect techniques only studies on radio-collared neonates and/or their
   dams were included, apart from a few notable exceptions. Neonatal
   mortality rates observed for different studies averaged 47\% (68
   studies) in environments where predators occurred, with predation
   accounting for an average of 67\% (53 studies) of this mortality. No
   other single cause of mortality exceeded that of predation, which
   accounted for 0-100\% of the mortality recorded in various studies. In
   contrast, mortality averaged 19\% for studies in environments lacking
   predators. Other prominent causes of mortality were
   hypothermia/starvation and accidents. Disease was found to play a small
   role only. The predator species involved varied greatly between study
   areas, with both medium sized (bobcat Lynx rufus, Canada lynx Lynx
   canadensis, coyote Canis latrans and red fox Vulpes vulpes) and large
   (wolf Canis lupus, mountain lion Fells concolor, black bear Ursus
   americana and brown bear Ursus arctos) terrestrial predators preying
   upon the neonates. Despite the prominent role of predation. little is
   known about its long-term compensatory or additive nature, and therefore
   its impact on population dynamics is unclear. Factors influencing
   predation rates are poorly understood, although a few studies found
   significant sex-biased predation, and effects of weather or
   juvenile/maternal body condition. Timing of mortality within the first
   summer varied with the predators involved and the neonatal security
   strategy of the species, but was not confined to the immediate
   post-partum period.},

Abstract = {We quantified divergence in phenotype of sea-ranched, farmed, and wild
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) of a common genetic stock (River Imsa,
   Norway). These first-generation fish were also contrasted with a
   fifth-generation farmed population (Norwegian commercial strain) and
   with wild and multigeneration sea-ranched populations of coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In comparisons using mature Atlantic salmon male
   parr, cultured juveniles had smaller heads and fins and narrower caudal
   peduncles and could be distinguished from wild juveniles with 100\%
   accuracy. When juveniles were reared to adulthood in the natural marine
   environment, some environmentally induced differences due to juvenile
   hatchery rearing persisted but many disappeared. This was particularly
   true for head and trunk morphology. Greater adult divergence from the
   wild state was observed in multigeneration sea-ranched coho salmon,
   suggesting that evolutionary changes may accumulate with time. Continued
   farming of salmon juveniles through adulthood increased environmentally
   induced phenotypic divergence considerably. Both rayed-fin sizes and
   body streamlining decreased. Fifth-generation Norwegian farmed salmon
   showed the greatest morphological differences. Both the proportion of a
   fish's life history and number of generations spent in culture are thus
   probably important determinants of phenotypic divergence of cultured
   fish from their wild state.},

Abstract = {Prey preferences and dietary differences between sex and age categories
   of Eurasian otters were studied in coastal Norwegian habitats. Relative
   to their trapping frequency potential prey species with hard, spiny
   exoskeletons (crabs and sea urchins) or other wise tough, spiny
   integuments (Labridae) were much less frequently found in spraints than
   fish species with soft integuments. Spines did not protect fish with
   otherwise soft integuments from otter predation. The number of non-fish
   taxa per otter stomach did not vary significantly between otter age
   categories despite presumed differences in hunting abilities (small
   cubs, large cubs and subadults, adults). Relative frequency of
   occurrence of crabs and sea urchins was <5\% in the stomachs in each of
   these otter categories. Anadromous, katadromous and freshwater fish
   species were infrequently eaten. The coastal otter population during the
   study period probably had access to an adequate, and preferred, supply
   of marine fish prey.
   At the otter population level on prey size selection was conclusively
   demonstrated within the range of fish sizes sampled. However, fish sizes
   eaten differed significantly between otter sex and age categories. The
   fish sizes per stomach were on average larger in males than in females,
   regardless of age. Adult males tended to eat the largest fishes. Among
   the self provisioning age categories (subadult and adult otters) fish
   lengths differed significantly between otter males and females, but not
   between the otter age categories, and did not covary significantly with
   otter body length. Fish eaten by females with old placental scars
   (potential mothers of fisheating cubs) were significantly smaller than
   those eaten by small cubs, provisioned by their mothers.},

Abstract = {The seasonal distribution of reproductive phases in female otters and
   the recruitment of cubs were studied by using information from carcasses
   collected along the central and northern coast of Norway. Relationships
   between available prey and female body condition were investigated.
   Conception, parturition and rearing of cubs, at least up to the age of
   5-6 months, occurred successfully at all times of the year. However, the
   main birth peak occurred in summer and autumn. The frequency of all
   phases of the breeding cycle, from follicle enlargement to early stages
   of cub rearing, varied consistently between seasons. Food availability
   when the cubs were c. 2 months old, and energetic demands on the female
   assumed to be greatest, was probably the main ultimate cause of the
   seasonal variation in the recruitment of cubs. Intrauterine mortality,
   possibly due to the seasonal variation in body condition of females, and
   loss of litters, may have been important mechanisms in creating the
   seasonal recruitment patterns. Although the prey biomass on average
   showed seasonal variation, the peak season shifted among years and
   locations. It is argued that the availability of suitable prey for
   otters tend to be unrelated to the seasonal productivity in aquatic
   environments, due to species-specific growth and behavior of prey and
   restrictions on the hunting capability of otters. Continuous
   reproduction with seasonal variation in birth rates may have been
   maintained by selection for reproductive riskreduction in a
   nutritionally unpredictable, although generally seasonal, environment.},

   GRADIENT},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {349-359},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The demography and abundance of Collembola in relation to a adient of
   increasingly isolated tussocks of Carex ursina were investigated near
   Ny-Alesund, Svalbard. The study area was divided into three zones
   according to tussock density. Ten tussocks were sampled in each zone. In
   addition, samples were taken between tussocks, which consisted of ground
   covered with a layer of cyanobacteria. A total of ten Collembola species
   were found, five of which were chosen for further studies. The Carex
   tussocks were the preferred habitat for the majority of these species.
   Only one species, Hypogastrura viatica, was found regularly between
   tussocks, although at low density. The gradient in tussock distribution
   was probably an important factor in determining the distribution,
   abundance and the underlying demographic processes of most species. This
   was indicated by an increase in demographic heterogeneity with patch
   isolation. The different species were affected differently, however.
   Whereas one species appeared to be unaffected by the gradient (H.
   viatica), two species (H. longispina) and (Folsomia sexoculata) were
   somewhat surprisingly found to have their highest density where tussocks
   were furthest apart. Factors other than the spatial configuration of the
   habitat are probably important in determining the distribution of these
   two species, indicated by a positive correlation at tussock level
   between them. In accordance with general hypotheses on the effect of
   patchiness on population dynamics the remaining two species, F.
   quadrioculata and Onychiurus groenlandicus, occurred in very low numbers
   or not at all, respectively, in the zone where tussocks were furthest
   apart. Their response is probably dependent on their ability to
   successfully colonise isolated tussocks. We predict that different
   species specific demographic strategies, and in particular dispersal
   rates, may account for the observed patterns.},

   proportion of source habitat than the sink-dominated landscape.
   Population density was twice as high in the source-dominated landscape
   (P = 0.002), but variability was not different (P > 0.10). In the
   source-dominated landscape there was a residual carry-over effect from
   par to year, as indicated by a significant autocorrelation in density
   with a l-yr time lag. However, in the sink-dominated landscape there was
   no significant autocorrelation with a I-yr time lag. Population trends
   were stationary over the 30-yr period in both landscapes. Power analyses
   suggested that autocorrelation with I-yr time lag, i.e. correlation
   between density in year x and x+l, was better to distinguish source from
   sink habitats than differences in density or variability.},

Abstract = {DETERMINISTIC models demonstrate that when the economic discount rate of

   rate, the strategy that maximizes the present value of cumulative
   harvest is immediate extinction (liquidation) of the population(1-3).
   Here we analyse stochastic models to derive optimal strategies that
   maximize the expected present value of cumulative harvest before
   extinction of a fluctuating population. Stochastic models reveal that
   discount rates below the critical value can substantially reduce the
   mean time to extinction and the expected real harvest before extinction.
   With an unstable equilibrium at small population size (Allee effect(4-6)
   or depensation(2)), the critical discount rate is lower in the
   stochastic model than in the corresponding deterministic model. These
   results argue against economic discounting in the development of optimal
   strategies for sustainable use of biological resources.},

   a sample of 405 Great Snipes from Norway, 98.7\% of the males of known

Abstract = {Annual variation in two sexually selected male traits, carcass mass and
   number of antler points, was studied in 2,862 moose (Alces alces)
   collected during the autumn hunting season in northern Norway during 23
   years. Yearling males grew larger during cool and dry summers, but a
   decrease in mean carcass mass of adult males was best predicted from the
   decline in sex ratio. However, because population density was
   significantly correlated with sex ratio, the two effects were difficult
   to separate. Males were smaller when population density was high and the
   male: female ratio was low. Carcass mass in female moose was unaffected
   by density or sex ratio, except in the case of yearlings. The cohort
   effect of large size of yearling only persisted for 1 year among males.
   Antler size did not change during the study despite the decline in body
   mass of males; this implies that the costs of bearing antlers of a given
   size increased. Variation in sexually selected characters in males may
   be understood by considering them to be life-history traits.},

Abstract = {We manipulated the investment needed by puffins to successfully raise a
   chick by experimentally reducing or prolonging the nestling period. The
   nestling period in one group was prolonged by replacing their 20-d old
   chick with a 6-d old foster chick. It was reduced in a second group by
   reversing the process. A third group was not manipulated and used as a
   control. When small chicks were replaced by large chicks, the growth
   rate of the new chicks did not differ from control chicks of similar
   age. When large chicks were replaced by small chicks the new chicks grew
   normally until the normal fledging time of controls. However, a
   significantly higher proportion of the chicks in the prolonged group was
   deserted by the parents. The few parents in the prolonged group that
   extended their nestling period were in poorer body condition at the end
   of the nestling period than were controls and parents with a reduced
   nestling period. The results show that, within the normal nestling
   period, the parents quickly adapted their feeding effort to the chick's
   needs, but that the amount of parental effort was regulated by the
   length of the period since hatching. The few parents that extended the
   nestling period did so at the expense of their own body condition.},

Abstract = {The causes of collision and electrocution accidents involving birds and
   power lines, and measures to mitigate such accidents, are reviewed.  It
   is convenient to group the causes according to (1) biological, (2)
   topographical, (3) meteorological and (4) technical aspects.  As regards
   collisions with power lines, the important biological variables are
   connected with the morphology, aerodynamic capability, physiology,
   behaviour and life-history strategies of birds.  To understand the
   electrocution problem, the relationship between body size and
   electrocuting installations must be considered.
   Removing earth wires (and modifying earthing methods), modifying line,
   pole and tower design, installing underground cables and conspicuous
   marking of lines, poles and towers are important measures for tackling
   the problems.  The route planning process should include careful mapping
   of (1) topographical features which are leading lines and flight lanes
   for migrating birds and/or are important for local movements of resident
   species, (2) topographical elements such as cliffs and rows of trees
   that force birds to fly over power lines, (3) primary ornithological
   functions or uses of the area to avoid key areas for birds and avoid
   separating these areas and (4) local climatic conditions (including
   seasonal variations) like fog frequency and prevailing wind direction. 
   The outcome depends largely on a combination of these factors.
   Objective assessment of the effects of mitigating measures, in
   particular wire marking, is required.  The mitigating efforts should be
   directed against species known to be potential collision victims, and
   their design should be the result of a careful analysis of the biology
   and ecology of the target species.
   Because of the cumulative effects of negative impacts on bird
   populations today and the alarming number of species with endangered or
   vulnerable status being killed in connection with utility structures,
   the problem deserves increased general awareness.},

Abstract = {In this study we test which environmental factors are influencing the

   silver eels upriver after catching them in a trap at the outlet of the

   years. Over 74\% of the variation in time from release to subsequent
   recapture could be accounted for by variation in time at release, water
   discharge at release, and moon phase at release (in decreasing order of
   importance). The number of days to median day of recapture of each batch
   decreased as the season progressed and decreased with increasing water
   discharge. Water temperature did not explain any of the remaining
   variation in the model, even if there was a significant correlation
   between water temperature at release and median day at recapture of each
   batch (in simple linear regression model). Recapture rate during the
   same migration season varied strongly with water temperature, but at
   most 33\% of the Variation could be explained by this factor. It was
   also evident that the recapture rate increased when the number of
   downward migrating untagged silver eels was high. Day length (i.e. time
   at release) did not explain any of the remaining variation in recapture
   rate.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a model in continuous time that allows us to
   analyse how an individual should allocate resources to growth and
   reproduction in order to maximize its lifetime contribution to future
   generations. Assuming that the death rate only depends on age, the
   allocation of energy is the solution of an optimization problem defined
   by a life history model. Making particular assumptions for the
   individual's potential for growth and reproduction covering many
   situations of biological interest, the precise solution can be written
   up explicitely. Hence the effect of the various parameters may be
   analysed in detail. In general, the individual should first use all its
   energy to growth, then at a certain age invest a proportion of energy
   into reproduction. This fraction increases as the individual grow older.
   In some situations growth finally stops, while for other parameter
   values the individual continue to grow until it dies. This model was
   used to examine, for the von Bertanlanffy's growth curve, the effects on
   age and size at maturity of changing the age-specific mortality rates.
   In general, the growth changes From a determinate growth to an
   indeterminate growth pattern when the mortality rate increases. In
   particular, a strong effect was found when the juvenile mortality
   increased. Rapid growth was also found to favour early maturation. (C)

Abstract = {An examination of the prey size of 101 altricial bird species showed
   large interspecific differences in the gross energetic content of the
   prey items. These differences in prey size were related to variation in
   reproductive strategies of this group. In accordance with the argument
   presented by the English ecologist C. Elton, a lesser amount of food was
   brought to the nest in taxa of altricial birds specializing on small
   prey items. However, this relation disappeared after controlling for the
   effects of body weight. Two changes are likely to evolve as a response
   to a reduced ability by the parents to provision their offspring. A
   decrease can occur either in the clutch size or in the growth rate of
   the nestlings. The comparative analyses showed, after controlling for
   the effects of body weight and phylogeny, that in altricial birds a
   smaller clutch size was found in those species specializing on small
   prey items, whereas growth varied independently of prey weight.},

Abstract = {We calculated the daily energy intake of wintering cow and calf moose
   from a series of 24-h feces collections and from estimates of the
   digestibility and energy content of forages from four different habitats
   in Norway during a 3-year period (1984-1986). Habitats varied in
   condition from good to poor. In early winter, the estimated energy
   intake of cows ranged from 803 kJ.kg(-0.75).day(-1) in the good- and
   average-quality habitats to 573 kJ.kg(-0.75).day(-1) in the poor
   habitat. Estimated energy intake decreased by 15-30\% from early to late
   winter. The estimated energy intake of calves ranged from 920
   kJ.kg(-0.75).day(-1) in the good habitat to 414 kJ.kg(-0.75.)day(-1) in
   the poor habitat; a significant decrease over winter was not evident.
   The estimates of daily energy intake correspond to a browse wet mass of
   8-17 kg for cows and 4-10 kg for calves. In the good- and medium-quality
   habitats the average energy deficiency of adult cows over winter was
   estimated at 25-30\%.},

Abstract = {Egg addition and egg removal experiments in Common Eider, Somateria
   mollissima were carried out during three breeding seasons to examine
   their effect on final clutch size. When the third egg and all subsequent
   eggs were removed during the laying cycle, females did not respond by
   laying more eggs. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that
   egg-production is limited by body reserves; however the experiment may
   have been carried out too late in the laying cycle to make further
   egg-laying possible. When three eggs were added to nests containing two
   eggs females produced fewer eggs than a normal clutch. This suggests
   that females respond to egg parasitism by reducing their own clutch
   size. A reduced host clutch size suggests that availability of body
   reserves is not the only control of clutch size in Eiders, but that
   costs to incubate and/or to care for chicks may increase with increasing
   clutch size.},

Abstract = {Two-year-old hatchery-reared progeny of inlet- and outlet-spawning brown
   trout from Lake Tyrifjorden were released at the mouth of the R. Imsa,
   south-western Norway. There were significant differences in migratory
   direction of juveniles between the two populations. After release,
   juvenile fish from the outlet river population moved against the water
   current and ascended the R. Imsa, while the inlet river fish tended to
   migrate with the water current to the sea. This differential response to
   water current in juveniles appears to be due to genetic differences
   between the populations, and parallels that found in their ancestors'
   native environments.},

Abstract = {Biomass distribution and energetics of trophic levels in the pelagic
   ecosystem of the Barents Sea are presented as averages over several
   years for the whole Barents Sea using data from the research programme
   Pro Mare in 1984-1989 and mathematical ecosystem models. Average
   biomasses range from more than 3 tonnes carbon km(-2) (zooplankton) to
   0.1 kg C km(-2) (polar bears) and P/B ratios from 300 (bacteria) to
   0.035 (minke whales). However, the Barents Sea ecosystem is in a far
   from steady state with, for instance, capelin stocks ranging from 30-700
   kg C km(-2) between years and cod stocks from 150-700 kg C km(-2). As a
   general rule, the various fish stocks grow adequately, albeit at
   different rates, in years characterized by large influxes of water and
   high zooplankton productivity. The skewed populations distribution which
   arises in `'warm'' years may lead to grave imbalances in `'cold'' years
   and even to the `'collapses'' of stocks, such as of capelin in the
   eighties. The food requirements of average-sized stocks of cod, seabirds
   and marine mammals correspond to more than twice the average
   productivity of capelin. Thus other species of pelagic fish (herring,
   polar cod) and zooplankton obviously play major roles as prey for these
   animals.},

   associated with diet, i.e. browsers have relatively larger litters and

Abstract = {Intraspecific nest parasitism was studied during two breeding seasons at
   two common elder (Somateria mollissima borealis) colonies in Kongsfjord,
   Svalbard (79 degrees 55'N, 12 degrees 10'E). The density of breeding
   elders differed considerably from year to year and also among colonies.
   Parasitic eggs were identified through deviations from a normal laying
   pattern. Parasitic eggs (8\%) were laid in 16\% of the clutches at the
   dense colony. The corresponding values on the island with low breeding
   density were 1.6 and 2\% in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Parasitic eggs
   were laid in clutches of all sizes according to their availability. The
   parasitizing females laid 70\% of their eggs during the host's laying
   period. Parasitic laying occurred despite the constant availability of
   suitable nest sites. The hosts did not reduce their clutch size in
   response to egg parasitism. The rate of egg predation was significantly
   higher in parasitized than in nonparasitized nests. Parasitic eggs were
   laid late in the breeding period, suggesting that birds which were
   immature, in poor body condition, or had previously failed are salvaging
   some reproductive effort.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {1. Vegetation cover was manipulated within enclosures on a field
   boundary in southern England to test experimentally the effect on the
   overwintering of Tachyporus hypnorum and Demetrias atricapillus
   populations, species that use grassy boundaries of arable fields as
   refugia during winter.
   2. Winter survival was lowest for beetles enclosed on bare earth and
   highest for those enclosed on tussocks of Dactylis glomerata. The
   contrast in structural complexity of the experimental treatments caused
   a 44\%, 43\% and 36\% variation in the final densities of beetles during
   three successive winters.
   3. The densities of T. hypnorum on adjacent field boundaries were
   estimated from the composition of their vegetation cover and the
   survival rates of the beetles on different treatments. There was no
   significant difference between the number of T. hypnorum allocated to
   seven field boundaries by the model and the number of beetles sampled
   from soil and vegetation of those boundaries at the end of winter.
   4. The cover of boundaries by non-tussock grass species accounted for
   91\% of the predicted overwintering numbers of T hypnorum because
   tussock grasses and bare soil were not common on existing boundaries. We
   therefore considered the influence of boundary structure on the
   overwintering of the beetles.
   5. Higher winter densities of T. hypnorum were sampled from boundaries
   with deeper soil and greater vegetation height, that were wider and
   higher above the field level, with an east to west orientation, warmer
   mean daytime temperature and lower soil moisture.
   6. A quadrat survey was carried out in Norway on the equivalent group to
   T. hypnorum that comprised T. hypnorum, T. chrysomelinus and T. obtusus.
   With multiple regression, more individuals of Tachyporus spp. and other
   beneficial arthropods occurred in sampling units from boundaries raised
   higher above the field level that comprised grass cover with a high
   proportion of tussock grass.
   7. Other factors such as pre-winter crop husbandry, food supply and
   parasitism may affect the dispersal power, habitat selection and cold
   hardiness of beneficial arthropod species within available boundaries
   and account for the observed variation in beetle numbers.},

Abstract = {Two populations of anadromous Arctic char Saivelinus alpinus at the same

   Beiarelva Arctic char stay for the entire freshwater portion of their
   lives in the main river in running water. The Saltdal Arctic char mainly
   spawn, and the young stay until smoltification, in a lake that drains to
   the River Saltdalselva. The river-dwelling Arctic char grow better and
   smoltify at a lower age and at a smaller size than the lake-dwelling
   fish. They also reach maturity at a lower age, but at the same size as
   the lake-dwelling Arctic char. In both rivers, Atlantic salmon Salmo
   salar and anadromous brown trout Salmo trutta are the predominant fish
   species. The study demonstrated that anadromous Arctic char may exist
   sympatrically with Atlantic salmon and brown trout in running water. In
   the watershed where a lake is available, most of the Arctic char stay in
   the lake in spite of the better growth and lower smolting age that they
   might attain in running water.},

Abstract = {Presmolt Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus in the River Halselva watershed,
   northern Norway, were analysed with respect to growth and sex
   distribution. Two main hypotheses were tested: (1) females dominate
   among the first-time sea migrants; and (2) age at smoltification depends
   on presmolt growth rate. Our results showed no significant difference in
   sex distribution of first-time migrants. There was a low frequency of
   early maturing males in the population, and no differences between the
   sexes with respect to early sexual maturation were observed. The
   first-time sea migrants showed a higher presmolt growth rate than the
   nonmigrating parr in Lake Storvatn, the only take of the Halselva
   watershed. Based on both the low frequency of mature parr and the sex
   ratio in the smolt run, the population of Arctic char in the profundal
   zone in Lake Storvatn is predominantly anadromous fish. These fish
   migrate to sea at a greater age than the first-time migrants observed in
   the River Halselva and are thus `'temporarily'' resident. This differs
   from other northern Arctic char populations, in which permanent
   freshwater-resident fish often constitute the predominant part of the

Abstract = {This paper outlines different production strategies for farming Arctic
   char Salvelinus alpinus in Norway. Economics and marketing are also
   discussed. Based on recent results, the use of wild Arctic char for
   smolt production may represent an alternative to intensive smolt
   production. In addition, the effects on the remaining wild fish
   populations of intensively harvesting small char are positive. The first
   experiments with sea ranching of anadromous Arctic char in northern
   Norway show high survival and return rates after the first summer in
   sea. Arctic char forced to stay in seawater during winter experience
   high mortality and reduced growth. Problems attributed to low seawater
   tolerance in winter might be reduced by supplying freshwater, or by
   transferring the fish to brackish or freshwater. The relatively small
   Arctic char cannot compete in traditional markets with Atlantic salmon
   Salmo salar and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Further commercial
   development of Arctic char culture depends on marketing the species as a
   high-quality exclusive product.},

Abstract = {We studied the component community of lung-worms of the harbour
   porpoise, attempting to establish the relative importance of ecological
   and evolutionary factors on its development. The lungs of 64 porpoises
   by-caught in Norwegian waters were examined for helminths. Three
   pseudaliid species were detected. The porpoises appear to be readily
   colonized by lung-worms, the structure of the component community of
   calves being fairly similar to that of the remainder. Prenatal and/or
   transmammary infections might partly account for these early infections.
   However, host age was correlated with the number of lung-worm species,
   suggesting that the lung-worms map have heteroxenous cycles similar to
   other metastrongyloids. The lung-worm species tended to co-occur more
   often than expected by chance. This pattern is commonly observed in
   communities formed by phylogenetic relatives. Mean species richness of
   lung nematodes differed significantly among mammalian orders. However,
   species richness of marine species seemed very similar to those of most
   terrestrial species. This evidence suggests that phylogenetic factors
   seem more important than ecological ones in determining the number of
   lung-worm species in mammals.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the effects of weather during prelaying, incubation, and
   early chick periods on the reproductive success of Hazel Grouse Bonasa
   bonasia in southwestern Finland (14 years) and southern Poland (6
   years). Reproductive success was most clearly correlated with weather
   during the prelaying period in both areas, with days of precipitation
   correlating negatively and temperature positively. We suggest that the
   availability of nutritionally rich food and the ability of the females
   to obtain it during the prelaying period, when the females are rapidly
   gaining mass and forming eggs, determine in large part the reproductive
   success of Hazel Grouse. A literature review suggested that this is
   generally true for small grouse species. The larger species, which have
   greater endogenous reserves and invest relatively less in their

   larger species have higher growth rates and energy requirements,
   however, which is probably the reason why the reproductive success of
   the larger species is more affected by weather during the early chick

Abstract = {This study presents an alternative treatment of data from a
   comprehensive vegetation study in which the main gradient structure of
   boreal coniferous forest vegetation in southern Norway was investigated
   by ordination techniques. The data sets include vegetation samples of
   different plot sizes, supplied with measurements of 33 environmental
   explanatory variables (classified in four groups) and nine spatial
   explanatory variables derived from geographical coordinates.
   Partitioning the variation of the species-sample plot matrices on
   different sets of explanatory variables is performed by use of (partial)
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis.
   Several aspects of vegetation-environment relationships in the
   investigation area are discussed on the basis of results obtained by the
   new method. Generally, ca. 35 \% of the variation in species abundances
   are explained by environmental and spatial variables. The results
   indicate support for the hypothesis of macro-scale topographic control
   over the differentiation of the vegetation, more strongly so in pine
   than in spruce forest where soil nutrients play a major role. Towards
   finer scales, the primary topographical and topographically dependent
   factors lose importance, and vegetational differentiation is more
   strongly affected by the accumulated effects of the vegetation
   (including the tree stand) on soils, shading, litter fall, etc.
   The fraction of variation in species abundance explained by significant
   environmental variables was found to be ca. twice as large as the
   fraction explained by spatial variables. The fraction of variation
   explained by the supplied variables differed between data sets; it was
   lower for cryptogams than for vascular plants, and lower for smaller
   than for larger sample plots. Possible reasons for these patterns are
   discussed.
   Some methodological aspects of CCA with variation partitioning are
   discussed: improvements, necessary precautions, and the advantages over
   alternative methods.},

Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-17},
Abstract = {The density of adult (greater than or equal to 3 years) female brown
   bears Ursus arctos was estimated in two areas of Sweden from ratios of
   radio-marked and unmarked females consorting with radio-marked adult
   males during the breeding season. The resulting densities were 1.2 +/-
   0.81 (95\% confidence interval) adult females/1000 km(2) in a northern
   study area and 1.06 +/- 3.44 adult females/1000 km(2) in a southern
   area. These estimates were extrapolated to obtain a population estimate
   for Sweden using relative densities throughout the range of the species
   in Sweden, based on hunter-kill statistics, and observed rates of
   reproduction and juvenile and subadult survival. The total population in
   spring 1991 was estimated to be about 620 bears, with almost all females
   confined to four geographically separated areas, termed female core
   areas. A supplementary estimate, based on estimated kill rates of adult
   females in the study areas, was about 660 bears. Estimates based on
   hunter kill rates of marked bears gave minimum and maximum estimates of
   about 300 and 900 bears, respectively. Although these are not confidence
   intervals of the total population estimate, we believe that the true
   population size is included within these limits. Densities within the
   female cove areas varied from 50 to 100\% of those in similar habitats
   in European Russia. The bear population in Sweden appeared to have
   increased at a stable rate of about 1.5\% annually during the past 50
   years. Mean annual rate of legal harvest during 1943-1991 was estimated
   to be 55\% (+/- 2.1\% SD), suggesting a maximum sustainable rate of
   7.0\% for this population. The harvest increased at a rate of 9.6\%
   annually during 1981-1991, and apparently was at the maximum sustainable
   level during 1987-91.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of a native wild
   bird, Lagopus lagopus, as a monitor of environmental metal levels, in
   particular with respect to the influence of atmospheric deposition of
   metals from long-range transport. Specimens of willow ptarmigan were
   collected from ten different locations in Norway. The concentrations of
   cadmium, zinc and copper were determined in kidneys of birds from all
   sites. Mean cadmium levels in adult ptarmigan kidney ranged from 6-6 to
   48-5 mug g-1 (wet weight), with individual concentrations up to 71.0 mug
   g-1. These are among the highest cadmium levels reported in wild birds.
   The kidneys of adult birds contained 3-10 times higher cadmium levels
   than kidneys from juvenile birds in the same collection area, and most
   of the high cadmium levels probably reflect natural exposure, rather
   than atmospheric pollution. Concentrations of elements in kidney tissues
   were highly correlated with each other.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-126},
Abstract = {1. We studied age at niche shift and sexual maturity of Arctic chaff
   Salvelinus alpinus (L.) from a Norwegian lake in relation to their
   energy budget.
   2. Young Arctic charr (age -2) fed successfully on zooplankton giving
   them a significant energy surplus for somatic growth. Energy intake,
   however, levelled off at age -3 to -4, and decreased with age among
   older fish. Similarly, energetic costs increased from age -2 to -3 and
   then the costs levelled off and decreased, probably as a consequence of
   a niche shift from zooplankton to zoobenthos feeding in deeper water.
   This shift did not increase energy intake, but reduced costs, probably
   through higher feeding efficiency on the larger zoobenthos in the deeper
   water and reduced metabolism at lower ambient temperature.
   3. Growth rate influences the age at niche shift and maturity.
   Fast-growing males attained maturity, and changed feeding niche, younger
   and at a smaller body size than their more slow-growing conspecifics. By
   contrast, female size at maturity was largely independent of age. The
   association between growth rate and these life-history traits is
   probably an effect of the close connection between growth rate and rate
   of metabolism in fish. We develop a model where the timing of niche
   shift and sexual maturation are a function of metabolic rate.
   4. The estimated maximum weight from energy budget considerations was
   very close to the observed asymptotic size for Arctic charr in this
   population. Females matured at a size above the estimated optimum (c. 30
   g) and close to maximum size (c. 61 g). Male size at maturity, however,
   was more variable; some matured close to optimum size while others
   matured at twice that size. The concept of optimal size thus appears
   irrelevant in connection with size at sexual maturity of wild fish.},

Abstract = {To understand the ecological effects of the Chernobyl reactor accident,
   we investigated radiocesium (Cs-137) levels in Eurasian woodcock
   (Scolopax rusticola), earthworms (Lumbricidae), litter (dead organic
   materials lying on the ground), humus (beneath litter 2 em deep), and
   mineral soil samples (3-6 cm deep) from a heavily effected (20-60 kBq/m2
   {[}1 Bq = 1 nuclear fission/sec]) area in Norway. The highest
   concentrations measured in earthworms (1988 median = 142 Bq/kg) and
   woodcock (1986 median = 730 Bq/kg) were below levels that should affect
   animal health. Values above the European Economic Community's limit for
   human food (600 Bq/kg fresh mass) only were found in woodcock during
   1986. Radiocesium concentrations decreased (P < 0.001) in earthworms
   (40\%) and woodcock (95\%) from 1986 to 1990, There was no reduction in
   total radiocesium in soil over the same period. The relatively high
   radiocesium concentrations in woodcock during 1986 and the decreasing
   radiocesium ratio in woodcock to earthworms during the first years
   following fallout could have been caused by woodcock ingesting abiotic
   radiocesium with earthworms. The decrease in radiocesium in woodcock and
   earthworms during the study (1986-90) probably resulted from decreasing
   bioavailability of radiocesium during the first years after fallout
   rather than by radiocesium disappearing from the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Extracts of Cortinarius sanguineus - containing anthraquinones - and C.
   orellanoides - containing orellanine - were examined for their ability
   to suppress the toxicity of aluminium ions by a bioassay experiment
   using the saprotrophic basidiomycete Mycena septentrionalis as the test
   organism. The aluminium concentrations used were: b, 0.5, 0.5e1, 0.5e2,
   0.5e3, and 0.5e4 mM Al. All were given as aluminium sulphate, with or
   without the extract of Cortinarius sanguineus or C. orellanoides. The
   extract of C sanguineus suppressed the toxic effect of Al up to 0.5e3
   mM. The C. orellanoides extract inhibited growth of the test organism up
   to 0.5e1 mM Al and suppressed the toxic effect of Al up to 0.5e3 mM Al.
   Mycena septentrionalis grew rapidly in 0.5e2 and 0.5e3 mM Al.
   Chromatographic investigations indicated that Al was mainly bound to
   dermocybin-1-beta-D-glucopyranoside, but not to anthraquinone aglycones
   in the C sanguineus extract. Corresponding procedures for the C
   orellanoides extract revealed that Al was bound to orellanine (and
   orelline). Orellanine may form an Al-complex polymer at moderate Al
   levels and an Al-chelate at high Al levels. Aluminium removed the toxic
   effect of orellanine. The significance of a possible Al detoxifying
   mechanism for the tested fungi in nature is discussed.},

Journal = {SARSIA},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-155},
Abstract = {Small groups of harbour seals are scattered along the entire Norwegian
   coastline and in some fjords. Some of these groups are separated by long
   distances from larger populations, and these groups may run a risk
   extinction due to demographic and environmental stochasticity. Here we
   studied the viability of small groups of harbour seals assuming no
   migration between the smaller, isolated groups and larger populations.
   We applied a stochastic population model and population parameters
   recorded for harbour seals at the Norwegian coast. The model was divided
   into twenty-one different age categories (0-20 years of age), each with
   potential different survival and reproduction probabilities. Survival
   and reproduction were modelled at the level of the individual. The
   Minimum Viable Population (MVP) was defined as the minimum population
   size that ensures greater-than-or-equal-to 95 \% probability that the
   population will survive for a period of 100 years. For a hypothetical
   population that was stable using a deterministic population model, the
   MVP was about 50 seals. In a population with annual growth of 1\% the
   MVP was estimated at 30 seals. If hunting mortality of one seal per year
   was added to the latter population and the hunting mortality was random
   among all age groups of males and females, the MVP increased to about
   120 seals.},

Abstract = {Selection of winter feeding trees by capercaillie Tetrao urogallus was
   studied by sampling of needles of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris trees
   browsed by capercaillie and closely situated unbrowsed trees in 5
   localities situated in the southern half of Norway. Browsed trees
   contained higher concentrations of N than unbrowsed trees but no
   differences in P were found among browsed and unbrowsed samples. Needles
   eaten by capercaillie were significantly lower in resin content than
   needles from unbrowsed trees. For tannin, no differences between browsed
   and unbrowsed trees were found. Results give evidence that capercaillie
   select needles richest in N when the resin content is low, but when
   high, the birds select needles low in resin. Thus, both N and resin play
   an important role in selection of winter browse by capercaillie.},

Abstract = {We studied fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the number of antler points
   from a total of 2126 moose (Alces alces) bulls killed during the hunting
   season in central Norway over a period of 23 years. All age groups
   showed a positive relation between FA and the number of antler points on
   the largest antler (antler size, AS). Based on the assumption that only
   the highest-quality individuals can produce the largest and most
   symmetrical sexual traits, the results did not support the hypothesis
   that FA in sexual traits signals the quality of the possessor. However,
   a partial correlation analysis revealed a negative relation between FA
   and carcass mass when controlling for As. Thus relatively larger bulls
   in relation to their antler size produce more symmetrical antlers
   compared with relatively smaller bulls. Similarly, a regression analysis
   between FA and As in the different age groups revealed a significant
   age-dependent decrease in the regression coefficients. This suggests
   that older bulls are more able to cope with environmental stress during
   the development of the antlers than younger bulls. Thus, for a given
   antler size, the age of the bull can be signalled through the FA. We
   therefore suggest that quality signalling by antler size and FA could be
   an additional component of sexual selection on moose antlers.},

Abstract = {Groups of 2-year-old Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were released
   intermittently from the middle of April to late June 1986 into the River
   Ingdalselva in Central Norway. Their marine survival was estimated from
   return of tags. Their smolt status was assessed by morphological
   characterization (condition factor, smolt colouration), determination of
   gill Na/K-ATPase activity and seawater tolerance challenge tests
   (survival in water of 40 parts per thousand salinity, mortality and
   ionic regulation in water of 33 parts per thousand salinity). Return
   rates were highest for fish released during a period from late April to
   mid-May which coincided with the time of highest seawater tolerance of
   smolts. Prior to this period the fish were incompletely smolted, and in
   late May-June the fish had poor seawater tolerance. Recapture rates were
   positively correlated to survival after 1, 3 or 6 days in water of 40
   parts per thousand salinity, and negatively correlated to plasma Cl-
   concentration after 1 day in water of 33 parts per thousand salinity.
   There were no correlations between recapture rates and smolt
   colouration, condition factor, or gill Na/K-ATPase activity. The
   condition factor decreased slowly during the experiment. A complete,
   silvery smolt colouration was not attained until late May, whereas gill
   Na/K-ATPase activity remained high until mid-June when recapture rates
   were low.},

Abstract = {Migratory behaviour of adult wild and fanned Atlantic salmon during the
   last phase of the marine migration was analysed by radiotelemetry
   outside a large North Norwegian river. By tagging 39 wild and 40
   recently liberated farmed adult salmon in the fjord, distribution to
   rivers and migratory speed of salmon was estimated. The wild salmon
   studied had most probably originated from the River Alta, whereas the
   farmed fish had no earlier freshwater experience from the area of
   release. A higher proportion of the tagged wild fish (87\%) than farmed
   (50\%) was recorded in the River Alta. Farmed sermon spent a mean of 106
   h in the sea from release to entering the River Alta, while the
   corresponding figure for wild salmon was only 41 h. The results suggest
   precise homing to the River Alta in wild salmon, while released farmed
   salmon showed a more random distribution to neighbouring streams. The
   present results further suggest that large :rivers attract higher
   numbers of escaped farmed salmon than small rivers.},

Abstract = {Autonomic and behavioral response to fear stimulation (sudden noise 80
   dB) was studied in 12 sleeping infants at ages 8-50 weeks. The aim of
   the present study was to identify a possible passive defense response in
   infants. The response, which is widespread in birds and mammals, is
   characterized by apnea and bradycardia with circulatory changes as seen
   during the forced diving response. Upon stimulation, two respiratory
   responses were elicited: apnea preceded by irregular respiration or
   simple irregular respiration. Apnea was elicited in 58\% of stimulations
   at ages 8-16 weeks compared to 14\% at 28-50 weeks. The mean duration of
   apnea decreased from 7.8 s (+/- 1.8 s) at 8-13 weeks to 4.7 s (+/- 1.1
   s) at 17-20 weeks. The preceding irregular respiration increased from
   5.3 s (+/- 4.4 s) to 10.6 s (+/- 5.4 s) at the same ages. The heart rate
   response was biphasic and were interpreted as the orienting response.
   The mean deceleration in relation to apnea was 16\% at 8-16 weeks and
   was reduced to 8\% at 28-50 weeks. Infants of smoking mothers were more
   prone to respond with apnea than infants of non-smoking mothers (73\%
   versus 38\%). REM sleep and long postprandial sleep time increased the
   probability of apnea response (62\% versus 38\% and 66\% versus 35\%).
   The responses seen may be interpreted as expressions of the passive
   defense response.},

Abstract = {Most Norwegian salmon populations are characterized by small numbers of
   fish. The proportion of cultured salmon in these populations has
   increased together with the rapid growth of the Norwegian salmon farming
   industry. In several spawning populations, fish of cultured origin now
   exceed the number of wild fish. The cultured salmon occurring in
   Norwegian streams are largely dominated by escapees from fish farms,
   although some are released for stock enhancement and ocean ranching
   purposes. Life history characters in cultured salmon-for instance, age
   and size at spawning, time of spawning and migratory behavior-often
   differ from those of the local stock of wild salmon. Possible ecological
   effects of interactions in the freshwater stages are discussed. The most
   serious effects so far have been the introductions to wild populations
   of lethal parasites and diseases with cultured fish. In recent years,
   more than 30 populations of salmon have been completely wiped out by the
   monogean parasite Gyrodactylus salaris. High mortality of adult salmon
   has also been observed as a result of furunculosis in some streams. In
   biochemically detectable loci, small but statistically significant
   differences in allele frequencies exist between populations within and
   between rivers. Possible long-term effects of genetic interbreeding and
   erosion of local adaptations are discussed. Increased numbers of
   cultured salmon may also increase the fishing intensity on wild salmon.
   Suggestions to reduce negative effects of interactions from cultured
   fish are proposed.},

   one parent. The bird could then either decrease its own body reserves or
   reduce the food load to the chick. The manipulated birds decreased their
   food load and increased the feeding interval, compared with
   unmanipulated birds. Consequently, the rate of chick loss increased. No
   significant difference was found between the body weights of

Abstract = {Running waters are sensitive and rapid indicators of how whole
   watersheds become anthropogenically affected by, e.g. acidification.
   This paper reports and discusses the results of Swedish freshwater
   acidification research, for the period 1988-1993 and earlier. Changed
   biotic patterns are exemplified by increased occurrence of those green
   algae that indicate an increase in nutrients (nitrogen), reduced species
   richness of invertebrates (especially mayflies, crustaceans,
   gastropods), a general shift in proportion from invertebrate grazers
   towards shredders, decreasing populations of fish (salmonids, roach,
   burbot, minnow). Impact on birds (dipper, grey wagtail) appears less
   validated. The mechanisms for the changes in individual, population and
   community levels include elevated hydrogen, aluminum and cadmium
   concentrations that affect ion balance and respiration in fish and
   invertebrates, but also various behavior patterns (avoidance reaction,
   downstream movement, choice of spawning site), and developmental stages
   (molt and emergence of insects, hatching and growth of early fish
   stages). Al can ameliorate low pH temporarily but does not biomagnify
   along food chains, and neither predatory insects nor flycatchers seem to
   accumulate Al. It seems less likely that cadmium is a serious threat to
   invertebrates in `'normal'' concentrations at low pH. Iron precipitation
   can affect feeding ability and respiration of mayfly nymphs. That humic
   substances may mitigate metals still seems uncertain for fish and
   invertebrates. Generally, most changes in the biotic patterns of streams
   seem to be related to abiotic impact routes. Fewer changes are due to
   changed biotic interrelations, but some examples of changed competitive
   situations are given for invertebrates and fish. In all these cases of
   sublethal acidification stress, the ultimate effect is that growth,
   development and reproduction of the organisms are retarded. Relevant and
   sufficient knowledge seems to be lacking in three research fields of
   acidification impact on streams; viz. increasing occurrence of green
   algae in acidified streams; role of invertebrates in decomposition of
   leaves in acid waters; and recovery processes of fish and invertebrates
   after liming.},

Abstract = {We tested the idea that ruminants allocate their feeding time to habitat
   patches in relation to foraging efficiency. We used five tame red deer
   (Cervus elaphus) in an enclosure planted with four treatments of timothy
   grass (Phleum pratense) differing in their stage of growth. Older swards
   offered higher biomass but lower nutritional quality than younger
   swards. We observed time spent feeding in each treatment during each of
   seven trials. We measured goodness-of-fit between observed times and
   predictions from two alternative hypotheses differing in optimization
   strategy (maximizing versus matching), and a third, null hypothesis. We
   tested the hypotheses using two alternative currencies: digestible
   protein, and digestible dry matter or energy. Although digestible
   protein concentration and dry-matter digestibility were highly
   correlated (r=0.763, P<0.001), the wider range of digestible protein
   made it the much more sensitive measure of forage quality. Distributions
   of feeding time closely matched estimated intake rates of digestible
   protein (R(Pred)2 d = 0.899) across all animals and trials. The other
   hypotheses were rejected. The results have important ecological
   implications in showing the underlying role of food in the selection of
   habitat by ruminants, and that simple, mechanistic models of forage
   intake and digestion can be scaled up to the level of animal behavioural
   choices.},

Abstract = {Clutch-size determination in the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) was

   in good body condition cared for young (including adoption of the young
   of other females), while females in poor body condition abandoned their
   young soon after hatching. Repeatability (an upper limit to
   heritability) of clutch size, which for individual females varies from
   three to six eggs, does not differ significantly from zero. A hypothesis
   is proposed, suggesting that there is a trade-off involved in allocating
   body reserves to eggs, incubation, and care of chicks and that females
   use a particular clutch-size strategy related to their body condition

   decreasing mercury concentration gradient from south to north along the

   needles of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and consequences for capercaillie
   Tetrao urogallus feeding on the needles were studied. Samples of pine
   needles from localities receiving different amounts of acid rain were
   taken in early March. Concentrations of N and P were highest in needles
   from the most acidified areas, and N concentration was 35\% higher in
   the most heavily polluted area than in the least polluted. Secondary
   chemicals decreased significantly with increasing acidification.
   Concentrations of Cd in pine needles were closely correlated with the
   acid deposition levels, with highest concentrations in the most polluted
   area. Al concentration also increased with increasing acidification.
   These results provide evidence that acid rain increases the nutritive
   value of pine needles through a fertilizing effect. Enhanced levels of
   certain metals are considered too low to be directly toxic to
   capercaillie. However, behavioural anomalies cannot be excluded.},

Abstract = {We describe scaling of morphological variables that influence total
   insulation in eight species of marine mammals ranging in average size
   from 35 to 30 000 kg. We also calculate total heat loss and the
   partitioning of heat loss through the body surface and appendages.  For
   the eight species investigated, heat loss in 0-degrees-C water is
   appreciably higher than the predicted basal metabolic rates for small
   species such as the ringed seal. Rorquals, on the other hand, wilt
   probably not need to raise their metabolic rates to keep warm. At rest,
   10-30\% of the heat production of a resting animal is lost through
   flippers, fins and flukes. This amount can increase to 70-80\% during
   moderate exercise. Whole-body conductance scales with body size in the
   same way in marine as in terrestrial mammals, although conductance is
   higher for a given body size in a marine mammal.},

Abstract = {Diet and food resources of marine-feeding otters (Lutra lutra, Mammalia)
   were studied along the coast of central Norway, where otters breed in
   all seasons. The fish and crab fauna in the 0-10 m depth zone where
   otters forage were sampled and otter spraints collected monthly for
   three years. Results were compared with published data from Shetland
   where otters breed mainly in summer. Most of the main prey species
   showed significant seasonal variation in numbers or biomass, which
   tended to be low in late winter or spring. The variations during the
   rest of the year were not synchronized between species. The combined
   density of the main prey species of Shetland otters, which peaked during
   summer, was low in Norway. This species group, eelpout (Zoarches
   viviparus), butterfish (Pholis gunnellus) and rocklings (Ciliata sp.,
   Gaidropsarus sp.), also constituted a smaller fraction of the total
   catch in Norway than in Shetland. The non-seasonal or autumn and winter
   species, cod (Gadus morhua) and bullrout (Myoxocephalus scorpius),
   constituted a larger fraction of the catch in Norway than in Shetland.
   Thus the otter's food resources on the Norwegian coast were seasonal,
   being minimal during the early months of the year, but with no clear
   maximum season as there is in Shetland. This may explain the differences
   in reproductive timing in otters.},

Abstract = {Foraging activities of goosanders (Anatidae, Mergus merganser) were
   studied in relation to seaward migration of smolt in the River Halselva
   in northern Norway, 1987-1989. Birds aggregated in the estuary in June,
   during mass migration of smolts. When present in the estuary males and
   females spent 28.7 and 35.6\% of their time feeding. Only 15\% of dives
   resulted in birds' bringing prey to the surface and about 25\% of prey
   found in goosander stomachs were salmonids. For hatchery-reared smolts
   released in the estuary, average length taken did not differ from that
   available; for wild smolts of Arctic char, however, smaller fishes than
   those available were taken. For 1989, we estimate that goosanders took
   1\% of the hatchery-reared smolts released in the estuary, and 2\% of
   the wild smolts when smolts passed the estuary during seaward migration.
   As it is likely that less fit smolts (e. g. sick, injured, small) are
   most prone to predation, we argue that such a level of predation on
   migrating smolts from goosanders has only a minor impact on salmonid
   production. Suggestions to reduce predation are discussed.},

Abstract = {We studied vertical distribution, substrate preference and food choice
   of brown trout, Salmo trutta, from benthic gillnet catches at four
   littoral sampling locations in a Norwegian hydroelectric reservoir. The
   sampling locations had different bottom substrates; at one location the
   bottom substrate consisted of sand, while at the other three, substrates
   consisted of stones ranging 2-5 cm, 10-30 cm and 30-150 cm in diameter,
   respectively. Small-sized (< 160 cm) and intermediate-size (160-269 mm)
   brown trout were mainly caught close to the bottom (0-0.5 m above).
   Small-sized brown trout were caught in the highest frequency at the
   location with substrate consisting of 10-30 cm large stones.
   Intermediate-sized brown trout were also caught in highest frequency at
   this location, but were also caught in a high frequency at the location
   with sandy substrate. In contrast, the catches of large-sized
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 270 mm) brown trout did not vary with distance
   from the bottom or with substrate coarseness. The most important food
   items for the brown trout were aquatic insects, surface insects,
   Eurycercus lamellatus and crustacean zooplankton, mainly Daphnia
   longispina, Bythotrephes longimanus, and Holopedium gibberum. In
   accordance with the differences in vertical distribution, benthic food
   was more important to small than to large brown trout. We argue that
   small brown trout stayed close to the bottom to reduce aggressive
   behaviour from larger specimens, and that small brown trout were
   therefore more dependent on benthic food items. We also argue that the
   observed differences in substrate preference between the size groups of
   brown trout is explained by variation in access to shelter, visual
   isolation between individuals and benthic feeding conditions between
   locations.},

Abstract = {The Arctic is subject to considerable pressure from a rapidly expanding
   world tourism industry and increasing demands for oil and gas resources.
   The archipelago of Svalbard in the Norwegian high arctic contains the
   most accessible islands in the entire Arctic, but despite extensive use
   of the resources, they still contain some of the last true wilderness
   lands in Europe. The growth in tourism with visitors from all parts of
   the world combined with coal mining and oil and gas exploration call for
   a coordinated environmental policy. A research-based management plan for
   tourism and recreation has now been developed. Some management problems
   were encountered in designing a recreation opportunity spectrum plan for
   this extremely vulnerable environment. Although Svalbard in many ways is
   a unique area, the challenges to management are comparable to those
   found in regions further south.},

Abstract = {1. Arctic chaff Salvelinus alpinus underwent phenological and
   ontogenetic habitat shifts between the epibenthic and pelagic zones in
   five Norwegian study lakes. Juveniles exploited epibenthic areas until
   they reached a body length of 13-18 cm when many moved into pelagic
   waters during summer.
   2. Pelagic juvenile Arctic charr had larger age-specific lengths than
   their epibenthic counterparts, and few juvenile Arctic chaff moved from
   epibenthic to pelagic areas in the presence of large brown trout, the
   main potential fish predator present.
   3. The mean size of the smallest Arctic chaff in the uppermost 2 Secchi
   disc units of the pelagic area was positively correlated with the body
   size of the largest brown trout that were present, and with the water
   transparency of the lakes. The size of pelagic charr declined
   significantly with depth in all but one lake.
   4. Our results indicate that juvenile Arctic charr demonstrate a
   trade-off between food demand and presence of predators, and thereby
   distribute themselves according to food availability and risk of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {482-489},
Abstract = {1. Large variation was found in age of onset of reproduction among
   radio-collared female moose (Alces alces) in a population in northern
   Norway (69-degrees-N). Eight (50\%) of the individuals matured at 2.5
   years old, whereas age of maturity was 3-5 years or older for eight
   females.
   2. Onset of reproduction was closely correlated with body weight. Both
   calf and yearling weight was significantly higher for those females that
   matured as 2.5 years old, compared with the other females.
   3. Average calf weight differed significantly among females; however,
   this variation was not significantly correlated with the mother's body
   weight.
   4. Calf weights were significantly correlated with the biomass of the
   herb species in the mother's summer home-range. A close relationship was
   found with the availability of some important forage species such as
   Lactuca alpina.
   5. Calf body weight varied independently of birth date. Single calves of
   experienced mothers were significantly heavier than twins.
   6. Yearling weight was significantly higher among females that stayed in
   the areas used as winter grounds (the central area) after they had
   become independent of their mother in their second summer. Females that
   moved to the surrounding areas had significantly lower weight gain and a
   delayed age at maturity, indicating a cost of dispersal. Thus, the
   distribution of age at maturity in a cohort will be strongly influenced
   by the proportion of females that succeed in establishing a home range
   in these areas.},

Journal = {ORNIS FENNICA},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-16},
Abstract = {We studied nest-site and post-nesting feeding site fidelity in a
   population of Common Eiders Somateria mollissima in North Norway during
   five consecutive breeding seasons (1986-90). Twenty-five per cent of the
   females that nested successfully and none of the unsuccessful females
   returned to the same nest. Whether females nested at the same site was
   independent of nesting variables other than total clutch loss.
   Similarly, nest-site fidelity did not result in nesting variables
   different from those of females which changed their nest-site. In
   contrast, fidelity to post-nesting feeding sites was very high (92\%).
   Females that showed post-nesting feeding site fidelity did not have a
   higher rate of nest-site fidelity than than other birds in the
   population. We therefore contend that in Common Eiders fidelity to a
   specific nest-site is less important than fidelity to the post-nesting
   feeding site. Going to areas where the female knows that sufficient food
   can be found is very important for both the female and her brood. In
   comparison to other duck species with more specific nest-site
   requirements (cavity-nesting ducks), Common Eiders have a low return
   rate to previous nest-sites, and we suggest that this reflects a
   difference in the availability of suitable sites.},

Abstract = {A new census and monitoring method for populations of breeding Puffins
   was developed and applied to the population on the island of Hernyken.
   The method is based on a star-shaped model of evenly spaced sampling
   plots throughout the topographic surface area of the colony. The main
   advantages of this approach are that all areas are equally represented,
   the variance of the estimates can be calculated, and it reveals changes
   in breeding density in any part of the colony as well as changes of the
   total colony area. The method can easily be used to survey other
   resources, even when operating on highly different scales. The number of
   apparently occupied Puffin burrows on Hernyken decreased from 119700 in
   1979 to 43 160 in 1988. This was presumably the result of very few
   chicks being reared by the Rost Puffins during 1969-1982. In 1983-1987,
   when no recruitment was expected, the annual population decline of
   13.7\% was independent of burrow density and probably equalled the adult
   mortality rate. In 1988, there was a significant recruitment of first
   breeders, and these birds settled in the most densely populated areas.},

   time at all sites, but declined most rapidly from initially higher
   values at inland locations at high elevations. As a result crude protein
   was positively correlated with altitude and distance from the coast in
   early summer and negatively correlated in autumn. The relationships
   between protein content, date and altitude were used to estimate the
   quality of the diet of twelve radio-collared female red deer that
   migrated to summer ranges in the mountains. Individual differences in
   body weight were significantly related to the estimated, mean crude
   protein in vegetation available during the summer. Constraints on the

Abstract = {We describe the summer diets of four seabird species, Kittiwake (Rissa
   tridactyla), Little Auk (Alle alle), Black Guillemot (Cepphus grylle)
   and Brunnich's Guillemot (Uria lomvia) collected in sea-ice-covered
   waters near Svalbard. Birds collected in an area filled with young
   sea-ice, within the seasonal sea-ice zone, were compared with birds
   collected from the perennial sea-ice zone dominated by multiyear ice.
   Pelagic Crustacea and fish dominated the diet of birds feeding in young
   ice, while sympagic Crustacea and fish were most important in the diet
   of birds feeding in multiyear ice. Boreogadus saida was the most
   important fish food item. B. Saida was present in the ice in both areas,
   while sympagic Crustacea were lacking in the area filled with young ice.
   Important food items in young ice were B. saida (Black Guillemots and
   Kittiwakes), Calanus sp. (Little Auks) and Pandalus borealis (Brunnich's
   Guillemot). B. saida (Black Guillemots, Kittiwakes, Brunnich's
   Guillemots), Gammarus wilkitzkii (Brunnich's Guillemot, Black Guillemot)
   and Apherusa glacialis (Little Auk) were most important in multiyear
   ice. In general, Black Guillemots and Kittiwakes fed on fish, whereas
   Brunnich's Guillemots fed on the larger, and Little Auks on the smaller,
   Crustacea. The importance of sympagic species in the diet of seabirds is
   thought to be closely related to the age and history of the ice in the

Abstract = {Four small lakes (0.9-7.5 ha) were each stocked with 500 individually
   tagged, 1-year-old hatchery-reared brown trout (Salmo trutta),
   corresponding to densities of between 67 and 250 fish ha-1. The lakes
   were treated with rotenone 1 year before stocking to eliminate pike
   (Esox lucius). Population estimates were carried out 14 months after
   stocking by the removal method, using a series of standard gill nets
   during two successive nights. No recaptures were obtained in a lake
   which still harboured adult pike. Population estimates in the three
   lakes ranged from 101 to 249 specimens, corresponding to survival rates
   of 0.2-0.5. The survival rates were positively related to initial
   stocking density. Both recapture rate and length at recapture were
   significantly correlated with initial fish length. Mean length at
   recapture as well as back-calculated length at the age of 2 years
   exhibited a negative relationship to fish density at the end of the
   study period. The greatest production (30.88 kg ha-1) was obtained in
   the lake stocked at the highest rate (250 fish ha-1). A higher growth
   rate in the lake with less fish could only partially compensate for
   slower growth in the more densely populated lakes. Hence, production in
   the lakes was limited by factors affecting survival.},

Abstract = {1. The elimination rate of radiocaesium in brown trout Salmo trutta L.
   was determined in the laboratory at four water temperatures (range
   4.4-15.6-degrees-C). In the experiments three or four homogenous
   size-groups of fish (mean weights 23-496 g) were studied at each
   temperature.
   2. The brown trout received acute oral doses of Cs-134 and were killed
   at intervals for radioactivity counting. The retention versus time
   curves were composed of two distinct exponential components. The
   long-lived component was quantitatively the most important for retention
   of radiocaesium. Elimination rate increased with increasing water
   temperature and decreased with increasing body weight.
   3. The biological half-life of Cs-134 (T(b) days) was related to fresh
   body weight (W, g) and water temperature (t, degrees-C) by the equation:
   T(b) = 290 x W0.176 x e-0.106xt. The elimination rate of Cs could be
   predicted from weight-specific metabolic rate as given by Elliott's
   equations for brown trout.},

Volume = {102},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This investigation is based on phytosociological and ecological analyses
   of stands dominated by M. struthiopteris within its main distributional
   area in Western Norway. The distribution and floristical composition of
   such stands are related to different environmental parameters such as
   regional climate, soil and topography. The data are analysed by
   numerical methods, of which two-way indicator species analysis
   (TWINSPAN), canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and simple
   discriminant functions (DISCRIM) are the most useful. Few stands occur
   in areas where the mean July temperature is below 12.0-degrees-C, and
   where the mean January temperature is higher than 0-degrees-C. The soil
   is rich in metal cations, with a base saturation mostly higher than 50\%
   in the B-layer. Based on a TWINSPAN classification of the 230
   investigated stands, 9 different groups (types) are distinguished. Many
   stands have a tree layer of Alnus incana, while stands with a canopy of
   Betula pubescens, Fraxinus excelsior and Ulmus glabra are considered to
   be marginal sites for M. struthiopteris. The types described are
   interpreted as belonging to the Pruno padi-Alnetum incanae, Alno
   incanae-Fraxinetum excelsioris and Alno incanae-Ulmetum glabrae
   associations within the Alno-Ulmion alliance. The floristic composition
   of the quadrats is highly correlated with the altitude/temperature
   gradient. The other important factor is interpreted to be soil moisture.
   Soil richness is poorly correlated with the floristic composition of the
   different stands. Several stands represent a regeneration stage after
   cessation in cultivation, while others appear to have been very little
   influenced by human activity.},

Abstract = {A fast, SiMple, and reliable method for estimating food consumption
   using radioisotopes is presented. The method gives both sensitive
   short-term and robust long-term estimates of food consumption for brown
   trout (Salmo trutta). The estimates of daily food rations were similar
   to those estimated from rates of gastric evacuation and laboratory
   experiments. The radioisotope method can be used to detect variations in
   ration size due to temperature, fish size, and food availability.
   Information on radiocesium absorption from this study and earlier
   published data on radiocesium retention can be used to estimate daily
   ration for both piscivorous and benthivorous brown trout. The
   radioisotope method can be used in radiocesium-contaminated lakes, but
   it could also be used in other experimental situations by adding stable
   cesium to small water bodies. The same method is also applicable for use
   with other stable or radioactive isotopes.},

Abstract = {Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957 is an important pathogen in
   Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. It can infect a
   wide range of salmonid host species, but on most the infections are
   probably ultimately limited by a host response. Generally, on Norwegian
   salmon stocks, infections grow unchecked until the host dies. On a
   Baltic salmon stock, originally from the Neva River, a host reaction is
   mounted, limiting parasite population growth on those fishes initially
   susceptible. Among rainbow trouts Oncorhynchus mykiss from the same
   stock and among full sib anadromous arctic char Salvelinus alpinus, both
   naturally resistant and susceptible individuals later mounting a host
   response can be observed. This is in contrast to an anadromous stock of
   brown trout Salmo trutta where only innately resistant individuals were
   found. A general feature of salmonid infections is the considerable
   variation of susceptibility between individual fish of the same stock,
   which appears genetic in origin. The parasite seems to be generally
   unable to reproduce on non-salmonids, and on cyprinids, individual
   behavioural mechanisms of the parasite may prevent infection.
   Transmission occurs directly through host contact, and by detached
   gyrodactylids and also from dead fishes. Relative importance of these
   routes and of different host species in the epidemiology of the disease
   is discussed with reference to laboratory experiments and existing
   knowledge concerning the host-parasite ecology.},

Abstract = {The interactions of predatory arthropods between natural habitats and

   also habitats which support greater general arthropod diversity? (3)
   Does the density of predators overwintering in field margins determine
   their distribution and abundance in adjacent cereal fields in spring?
   The value of field margins to agriculture was assessed as the density of
   arthropods overwintering in these habitats. The arthropod groups used
   for the assessment were known aphid predators which moved out into
   cereal crops in the spring. This assessment was compared with general
   arthropod diversity at each site to test whether field margins
   supporting high densities of predators were also of value to nature
   conservation in supporting greater arthropod biodiversity. In spring,
   the spatial dynamics of predatory arthropod species were investigated in
   cereal crops adjacent to field-margin overwintering sites. The influence
   of field-margin habitats on natural enemy populations within adjacent
   crops was evaluated. The enhancement of natural enemies and general

Abstract = {Recent studies of the lekking great snipe (Gallinago media) have shown
   that male mating success increases with display rate and the amount of
   white on the tail. An obvious question then arises: what is setting the
   limits to male display rate and to the evolution of even whiter tails?
   In this study the costs of these two traits are considered. In the case
   of the white on the tail, almost no predation was observed during the
   display period. However, predation on the winter grounds and/or during
   migration cannot be ruled out. Males differed in the amount of white on
   the tail between years. It is suggested that increasing the amount of
   white is costly, though the reason for this is still unknown. In the
   case of display rate, it is shown that predation cannot be a
   considerable cost, again because of the near absence of predation on the
   leks. Instead, it is shown that male displays are energetically costly.
   The daily energy expenditure of displaying males was estimated to be on
   average 4 times the basal metabolic rate, which is close to the supposed
   maximum sustainable work load for birds. Furthermore, males lost on
   average 1.8 g per h (1.7\% of the body mass) which is about 7.2 g
   (6.8\%) during a night of display activity. Males do gain some weight
   during the day when no displays are performed but loose on average 9 g
   during an 11-day period in the early part of the breeding season. These
   results indicate that high energetic demands set the limits to male
   display performance and that males do not have to trade off the benefit
   of attracting females by their displays against a cost of attracting
   predators.},

   diet, endoparasitic fauna, life history, time and place of spawning,
   early ontogeny, and population genetics. Head morphology in embryos,
   juveniles and adults revealed the presence of two charr morphotypes,
   each including two morphs: (1) a benthic morphotype including large
   benthivorous (LB-) and small benthivorous (SB-) charr, featuring
   overshot mouth and relatively large pectoral fins, and (2) a pelagic
   morphotype including planktivorous (PL-) and piscivorous (PI-) charr,
   featuring terminal mouth and relatively small pectoral fins. SB-charr
   mature sexually (50\%) at 2 (males) and 4 yr (females); asymptotic
   length is 133 mm. LB-charr mature sexually at 8 yr; asymptotic length is
   553 mm. PL-charr mature sexually at 4 (males) and 5 yr (females);
   asymptotic length is 205 mm. PI-charr mature sexually at 6 yr;
   asymptotic length is 302 mm. SB- and LB-charr both live in the littoral
   zone, but they segregate in microhabitat: LB-charr live epibenthically,
   whereas SB-charr live mainly in the interstitial spaces of the stony
   substrate. Their diet, however, is similar (Schoener's D = 0.34 - 0.89).
   Both feed mainly on the snail Lymnaea peregra. PI-charr live mainly
   epibenthically, feeding on sticklebacks and juvenile charr. PL-charr is
   the most numerous morph in the lake. It lives both in the pelagic and in
   the epibenthic zone, feeding on crustacean zooplankton and chironomid
   pupae. The young of the year of all morphs live in the littoral zone
   where they feed on chironomid larvae. All morphs spawn in the littoral
   zone, LB-charr spawn in July-August, PL- and PI-charr spawn in
   September-November, whereas SB-charr spawn during August to November.
   Genetically, the morphs are very similar; Nei's genetic distances were
   between 0.00004 to 0.00126. The only significant difference found was
   between SB-charr and the other three morphs combined. The four morphs
   are conspecifics, although they may be reproductively segregated to some
   extent.},

Abstract = {The annual yield of the commercial fishery for planktivorous charr
   ({''}murta{''}) in Thingvallavatn has varied between zero and 73 tonnes
   since 1958, with two periods of high catches: 1963-1965 and 1976-1984.
   The commercial fishery is performed with 22 mm bar mesh gill nets on the
   spawning grounds. The nets selectively catch mature fish over 17.5 cm in
   length. From 1983 to 1987 the catches decreased from 63 tonnes to zero.
   During this period mean size of murta spawners decreased from 18 to 13
   cm for males, and from 19 to 15 cm for females, without any reduction in
   age at maturity. This indicates that the reduction in fish size renders
   the commercial nets ineffective. There were no indications that the
   reduction in commercial catches was caused by overfishing or recruitment
   failure. Conversely, echo-sounder stock estimates indicated an increase
   in murta abundances from 1985 to 1987. No year-classes present in the
   catches appeared to be unusually weak, whereas several year classes
   (e.g. 1981, 1983, 1984) appeared relatively strong.},

Title = {FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE DURING WINTER OF A HERBIVORE, THE MOOSE, IN RELATION

Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {73},
Number = {2},
Pages = {542-550},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study was undertaken to provide an estimate of the functional
   response curve of the moose during winter.  The functional response
   consists of two components:  the intake rate while foraging and the time
   available for food searching.  In generalist herbivores an interaction
   may exist between those two components, because the quality of food
   eaten (expressed as digestibility) may limit the period available for
   grazing.  Thus, variation in intake rate while foraging in relation to
   food availability may give a biased estimate of functional response in
   such animals.
   We studied the relationship between the different components of
   functional response during winter for a generalist browser, the moose
   Alces alces, by comparing the intake rates of free-ranging individuals
   foraging on three Norwegian winter ranges of different quality.  The
   intake rate was determined by collecting feces defecated during a 24-h
   period by radiocollared individuals.  The amount of food eaten was found
   by multiplying the dry mass of feces with the inverse of the
   digestibility of the twigs eaten during that period.
   No relationship was found between intake rate and either snow depth or
   temperature.
   Body mass accounted for a large proportion of the variance in intake
   rates.  The slope in the regression of intake rate on body mass (b =
   0.73) was close to the one expected from Kleiber's law.  However, when
   calves and adults were analyzed separately, a significant allometric
   relationship was found only for the calves.
   The intake rates of both age groups increased linearly with resource
   availability.  This relationship also remained after accounting for the
   effects of body mass in a multiple-regression analysis.  The intake rate
   also increased with the digestibility of the twigs eaten.  However, twig
   digestibility was closely correlated with resource abundance in the
   present data set, so the separate effects of quality and quantity were
   difficult to estimate.
   In the present data set no significant relationship appeared between
   resource availability and the time used for foraging.  Thus, the
   functional response of winter-foraging moose was linearly related to the
   resource availability.  However, we suggest that the quality of the food
   also should be included in the computation of functional response curves
   of large herbivores.  Consequently, the functional response should be
   described in three dimensions as a function of quality and quantity of
   the food resources.},

   Medium-sized fish in this zone were in addition feeding on the larger

Abstract = {Radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident affected parts of
   central Norway to a considerable extent, in particular the Cs-134 +
   Cs-137 deposition had a significant impact on the natural environment. 
   When this became apparent, a comprehensive radioecological research
   programme was initiated in order to study the behaviour of radiocaesium
   in boreal and alpine ecosystems, with emphasis on food-chains leading to
   exposure of species used for human consumption, i.e., reindeer and
   freshwater fish.  In this paper results from the terrestrial part of
   this research programme during the period 1986-1990 are presented.  The
   work was mainly confined to the mountain areas of Dovre and Rondane. 
   Parallel studies were performed in eutrophic and strongly oligotrophic
   communities.  The influence of local variations in topography and
   microclimate on the observed radiocaesium levels in topsoils, lichens
   and vascular plants was studied in detail.  Currently a significant
   re-distribution of radiocaesium from the originally strongly exposed
   surfaces to those that were less exposed is observed.  In the soil,
   radiocaesium is strongly retained in the litter and raw humus layers. 
   Current levels in lichens are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than in
   vascular plants.  This strongly affects the seasonal variation of
   radiocaesium in reindeer, showing winter maxima of about 5 times higher
   than the August levels.  The radiocaesium levels in reindeer showed a
   decline of approximately a factor of 3 during the period 1987-1990. 
   Other animal species studied in the programme exhibited substantially
   lower radiocaesium levels than reindeer, but a considerable interspecies
   variation was observed.},

   gardens{''} can serve as a paradoxical barrier to managing wildland
   areas and users for outdoor recreation.  This article discusses the
   apparent paradox between free access and management of wildland
   recreation, the underlying principles of both concepts, and proposes an
   integrative basis for how the two concepts can serve the same major
   goal-freedom of access and use of wildland recreation areas without
   disturbance to other users or the resource base.  A Norwegian field
   study is presented with campfire data and management strategies to
   illustrate the integrative nature of common access and wilderness
   management principles for the managing of wildland recreation
   opportunities.},

Abstract = {In northern Norway, Larus fuscus fuscus feeds mainly offshore on the
   wing on pelagic fish and fishery discards.  It avoids competition with
   other large gulls for concentrated stationary food sources such as

   Gull L. argentatus and the Great Black-backed Gull L. marinus when
   competing for large food items behind stationary or slow-moving fishing
   boats.  However it is superior in obtaining small items from fast-moving
   boats.  Nominate fuscus is clearly more specialised in its feeding
   biology than L.f. graellsii and L.f. intermedius.  It also shows clear
   differences in morphology, migration route, moulting cycle, population
   parameters and population development, and may be specifically different
   from graellsii and intermedius.  During the last decades the breeding
   population of nominate fuscus in northern Norway has decreased
   alarmingly.  Food shortage is thought to be the main reason for this
   decrease.},

Volume = {134},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-43},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Great Snipe Gallinago media is considered to be an endangered
   species. This paper examines its food and habitat use on a
   sub-alpine/low-alpine breeding area in central Norway. It was estimated
   that earthworms constitute more than 90\% of Great Snipe food (by
   weight). Feeding birds selected the low herb willow scrub vegetation
   community and to a lesser degree eutrophic fen. Birds did not
   selectively feed on eutrophic dwarf birch/juniper heath despite it being
   the third most used vegetation community by virtue of its extent.
   Although soil penetrability, vegetation cover and earthworm density
   varied across vegetation communities, Great Snipe selected sites with
   similar habitat characteristics in different vegetation communities.
   Great Snipe seemed to select for an optimal combination of soil
   penetrability and earthworm density, and for medium scrub cover. Nests
   were found in a broad range of vegetation communities, but only low herb
   willow scrub was selectively used. However, an equal number of nests was
   found in eutrophic fen due to its larger extent. Dense vegetation cover
   around nests and short flushing distance of incubating females indicate
   low sensitivity to disturbance. We consider the Great Snipe to be a food
   and habitat specialist, requiring habitats rich in sub-surface
   invertebrates to breed. This may explain its scattered distribution in
   Scandinavia, and may render it vulnerable to habitat modification and
   loss.},

Title = {DIET DIFFERENTIATION IN POLYMORPHIC ARCTIC CHARR IN THINGVALLAVATN,
   ICELAND},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-35},
Abstract = {1. The diets of four Arctic charr morphs (Salvelinus alpinus (L.));
   small benthic (SB), large benthic (LB), small limnetic (SL) and large
   limnetic (LL), were analysed on a seasonal and diel basis in different
   habitats in lake Thingvallavatn, Iceland. All morphs used the littoral
   habitat (littoral stony zone, 0-10 m depth, and littoral Nitella zone,
   10-20 m depth), but limnetics also used the pelagic habitat (0-70 m
   depth).
   2. The morphs exhibited dietary specializations, strongly correlated
   with distinct differences in trophic morphology. Benthic morphs foraged
   on zoobenthos, especially the mollusc Lymnaea peregra. Small limnetics
   fed extensively on open water foods, particularly zooplankton, whereas
   large limnetics preyed mainly upon threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus
   aculeatus, less on Arctic charr. Diet of limnetics differed slightly
   between habitats.
   3. Seasonal and diel changes in diet composition were slight, and
   benthics and limnetics did not overlap in each others specific diet.
   However, all morphs converged in spring upon insect pupae that are then
   superabundant. The food segregation between benthics and limnetics was
   established from age 1 (fork length c. 7 cm) and onwards.
   4. The size of snails eaten increased with increasing size of benthic
   charr, and the size of charr eaten increased with increasing size of LL
   charr. This is explained in terms of ontogenetic gape limitations.
   Larger snails eaten by SB charr relative to those eaten by similarly
   sized LB charr may be the result of the larger head and more subterminal
   mouth of SB charr, endowing them with greater ability to engulf larger
   snails. It is suggested that LL charr are ecomorphs of SL charr which,
   through ontogenetic shifts, switch from planktivory to piscivory at the
   size of 22 cm.
   5. All morphs, except LL charr, showed peaks in stomach filling and fish
   caught in gill-nets around twilight in autumn. Depending on the morph,
   this may be linked with diel variation in availability of food
   organisms, and risk of predation by LL charr.
   6. Strong correlations between ecology and morphology suggest that the
   benthic and limnetic morphs are adapted to the littoral benthic and
   pelagic niches respectively of Thingvallavatn. Low fish species
   diversity, discreteness, and stability of alternate niches in the lake
   may be important factors in reducing competitive interactions, and thus
   promoting coexistence by phenotype-specific preferences for resources.},

Abstract = {Vendace (Coregonus albula) in Lake Mjosa lived in the pelagic zone and
   gillnet catches were correlated with water temperature (r2 = 0.457, p <
   0.005). Whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) exploited both epibenthic and
   pelagic areas. Whitefish with body lengths between 25 and 35 cm moved
   from the epibenthic to pelagic zone during summer; other length groups
   remained in epibenthic habitats. The pelagic fish returned to epibenthic
   areas in the autumn, Cladocerans were important food items for both fish
   species in the pelagic zone. The large copepod Limnocalanus macrurus was
   eaten only by vendace whereas surface insects were more important prey
   for whitefish. This suggests that vendace is the more specialized
   zooplanktivore. The pelagic gillnet catch of whitefish and the pelagic
   habitat overlap between whitefish and vendace increased with increasing
   zooplankton densities at depths between 0 and 50 m (r2 = 0.609 and
   0.494, respectively, p < 0.01). During spring and autumn we observed a
   time lag between the change in zooplankton abundance and habitat
   switches of whitefish. The fish moved to the more profitable habitat
   several days after food availability had changed, indicating an element
   of learning in choice of habitat.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {(1) The radioactivity of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) and Arctic charr
   (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) was monitored in a Norwegian lake from 1986 to
   1989.  A distinct difference was observed between brown trout and Arctic
   charr in the accumulation of radiocaesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) from the
   Chernobyl fallout, and the study focused on the understanding of this
   difference.
   (2) Brown trout had a large food consumption and a corresponding high
   intake of radiocaesium.  Excretion was 20\% faster in brown trout than
   Arctic charr as brown trout lived at high temperatures in epilimnic
   water.  Arctic charr had a lower food consumption (less than one-third
   of trout) and lived in colder meta- and hypolimnic water.  Arctic charr
   therefore had a lower intake and slower excretion of radiocaesium.
   (3) Brown trout and Arctic charr had different diets.  For brown trout
   zoobenthos was the dominant food item, whereas Arctic charr mainly fed
   on zooplankton.  The radioactivity in the stomach contents of the two
   species was different in 1986, but similar for the rest of the period.
   (4) Higher levels of radiocaesium in brown trout than Arctic charr in
   1986 were due to a higher food consumption and more radioactive food
   items in its diet.
   (5) The parallel development in accumulated radiocaesium through summer
   1987 was probably formed by brown trout balancing a higher intake with a
   faster excretion.
   (6) The ecological half-lives of radiocaesium in brown trout (357 days)
   and Arctic charr (550 days) from Lake Hoysjoen indicated a slow removal
   of the isotopes from the food webs.},

   did not differ significantly between the two groups. After 1 year in the
   sea, most surviving fish in both categories returned to coastal Norway
   as sexually maturing adults. Smaller numbers returned as
   multiple-sea-winter spawners. Wild fish ascended the River Imsa earlier
   in the season than did hatchery fish. Furthermore, wild fish strayed
   less than hatchery fish to rivers other than the River Imsa. Within the
   river, hatchery fish moved about more, and a higher proportion was
   injured during the spawning period than in wild fish. Moreover, hatchery
   fish stayed for a shorter period of time in the river than wild fish,
   and a larger proportion of the hatchery fish returned to sea without
   having spawned. Average river survival was high (> 60\%) for both

   into the open sea. Numbers and percentages of adult salmon caught in the

   outside the river. Adults from smolts released in the river did not
   migrate farther upstream than adults released from marine sites. Adults
   homed to the area of smolt release, whether or not the fish were
   released in sea or fresh water. The results also showed that both
   recapture rates and straying increased with increasing release distance
   from fresh water.
   Consequently, both rates of recapture and straying of ocean ranched
   Atlantic salmon are strongly dependent on release location.},

   these fish ascend the rivers late in the season. Several sources of
   error affect the estimates, but there are strong indications that the
   proportion of reared salmon in nature has increased considerably in
   recent years. This is probably a result of the increased salmon farming
   activity in Norway, and the subsequent increase in number of salmon
   escaping from fish farms.},

Abstract = {Biological investigations connected with hydropower development of
   rivers in Northern Norway in 1975-79 coincidentally led to the discovery
   of the ectoparasite Gyrodactylus salaris as a serious problem for
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations in Norway. Regional
   research of Atlantic salmon rivers was initiated by a Gyrodactylus
   committee in 1980 and has been continued each year. G. salaris is most
   probably a recent introduction to Norway, and is now reported in 34
   rivers and about 35 hatcheries. The distribution of G. salaris in
   Norwegian rivers is connected with stocking of fish from infected salmon
   hatcheries. Populations of salmon parr have been severely reduced in
   infected rivers. In recent years catches of ascending salmon in these
   rivers have also declined. A primary goal of Norwegian fishery
   authorities is to prevent the further spread of G. salaris and to
   exterminate the parasite in as many infected rivers and hatcheries as
   possible. Extermination has been accomplished in the river Vikja in the
   Sognefjord by using rotenone treatment in 1981-82. G. salaris has not
   been found in this river following treatment.},

Abstract = {Longevity in 25 populations of anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta)
   showed a significant trend with increasing life span at latitudes of
   58-70-degrees-N in Norway, with the largest change from 58 to
   60-degrees-N. Moreover, longevity was negatively correlated with
   temperature and growth rate in freshwater and at sea. Body size was
   negatively correlated with water temperature and growth rate in
   freshwater, but not with latitude or water temperature and growth rate
   at sea. Thus, conditions influencing development and metabolic rates in
   fresh water seem more important than conditions in the sea in
   determining variation in longevity and body size of anadromous brown
   trout. Our results support the hypothesis that interpopulation variation
   in longevity and body size is influenced by rate of metabolism, chiefly
   influenced by ambient water temperature.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {(1) Habitat use and resource utilization of sympatric Arctic charr and
   brown trout in four lakes and allopatric Arctic charr in three lakes
   were investigated in central Norway. Fish were sampled both in
   epibenthic and pelagic habitats simultaneously with sampling of
   zooplankton resources. (2) Depth distribution of both Arctic charr and
   brown trout was correlated with Secchi disc transparency. Sympatric
   brown trout lived mainly in littoral areas down to 1 Secchi disc unit
   and were even more confined to near-surface waters in the pelagic zone.
   Sympatric Arctic charr were most abundant in epibenthic areas between 2
   and 5 Secchi disc units and between 1 and 2 units in pelagic habitats.
   However, allopatric charr used chiefly littoral areas down to 2 Secchi
   disc units, but they also utilized depths down to 8 Secchi disc units.
   (3) Generally, the food of allopatric and sympatric populations of
   Arctic charr differed greatly from that of brown trout. Typically the
   food overlap index calculated was lower than 70\%. (4) A comparison
   between habitat use of allopatric and sympatric charr indicated that
   Arctic charr were excluded by brown trout from littoral areas during
   summer. However, this habitat segregation was broken down in November
   through winter. (5) Habitat and resource utilization between Arctic
   charr and brown trout was explained by selective differences and
   asymmetric competition with brown trout as the dominant species in
   shallow areas from spring through autumn. In late autumn through winter
   (November-May), Arctic charr may be superior to brown trout because of
   higher activity at low temperatures.},

Abstract = {(1) Mean body length and mean sea-age at maturity of Atlantic salmon,
   Salmo salar, increased with increasing mean annual water discharge
   (1-300 m3 s-1) of the spawning river, r2 = 0.53 and r2 = 0.41,
   respectively. Rivers between 40 and 300 m3s-1, however, showed no such
   significant correlation. (2) Mean body length and mean sea-age at
   maturity also increased with passable length (4-126 km) of the spawning
   river, r2 = 0.30 and r2 = 0.24, respectively. However, passable river
   length did not add significantly to regression models having mean annual
   water discharge as the independent variable. (3) Among rivers, body
   length at sexual maturity for one-(r2 = 0.31) and two-sea-winter (r2 =
   0.34) fish increased with mean sea-age at maturity of the population.
   (4) Among post-spawners, some spawned annually, others biennially. The
   proportion of biennial spawners increased significantly with sea-age at
   maturity (r2 = 0.69). In rivers with mean sea-age at maturity between
   1.0 and 1.4 years, 0-40\% of the fish spawned biennially. In rivers
   where sea-age at maturity was between 2.0 and 2.3 years, 80-100\%
   spawned biennially. (5) The proportion of biennial spawners depended on
   fish size (r2 = 0.97). The majority of the smallest adults (< 60 cm)
   spawned annually, the largest (> 90 cm) biennially. (6) Recapture rates
   of tagged post-spawners decreased with increasing body length (r2= 0.45)
   suggesting that small adults had higher sea survival than large ones.},

Abstract = {In Common Eiders, females other than the mother often protect young from
   predators. This study was designed to determine if failed nesters and
   females which loose their young shortly after hatching (brood
   abandoners) participate in such rearing activities. Brood caring females
   always reacted aggressively towards approaching gulls and stayed close
   to the young during disturbance. The behaviour of failed nesters and
   brood abandoners towards broods and creches was similar. Their creche
   attendance was highly temporal and independent of the time since they
   had lost their eggs or hatched their young. They usually left the
   creches at the slightest disturbance, and during gull attacks failed
   nesters showed no reaction while a few brood abandoners tending creches
   reacted aggressively. Most of the creche attendance in nest-failing and
   brood abandoning females is presumably motivated by selfish interest,
   e.g. seeking safety from predators or kleptoparasites. The so-called
   ``visiting{''} females or ``aunts{''} in Eider creches should be divided
   in two categories: broody females showing protective behaviour and
   females temporarily attending creches and showing no broodiness. Failed
   nesters and most of the brood abandoners belong to the latter category.
   Most of the females showing protective behaviour probably belong to the
   non-breeding cohort (young and/or non-breeding birds).},

Title = {WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF PREDATORS ON LARGE UNGULATE POPULATIONS},

Abstract = {So far only a few studies have documented that food limitation regulates
   numbers in large ungulate populations. In this review I evaluate recent
   predator-ungulate studies to 1) assess the role of predators in
   regulation of ungulate populations, and (2) whether the outcome of such
   interactions could be predicted from predator-prey models. Recent
   studies suggest that environmental productivity plays a role in
   predator-prey interactions. In order to test this hypothesis I evaluated
   predator-large ungulate biomass data along a northsouth gradient from
   arctic to tropical ecosystems (3).
   (1) Several cases of limitation by predators were found. But in the
   majority of cases, in heterogeneous and seasonal environments, nomadism,
   prey refuges and differential prey-age vulnerability by the dominant
   ungulate species may have counteracted regulation by predators. In the
   more impoverished arctic and northern environments food-chains in some
   instances lacked predators and ungulates were food-limited, as were
   predators at low prey densities. In most instances predators were
   limited by territoriality.
   (2) Empirical evidence was only rarely (and in most instances untested)
   in agreement with predictions from predator-prey models.
   (3) Support for the hypothesis that higher environmental productivity
   facilitates predator regulation of ungulates was not evident.
   Studies so far suggest that spacing behaviour by ungulates due to
   environmental heterogeneity could be the single most important factor to
   counteract regulation by predators.},

Abstract = {In experiments with two different salmon (Salmo salar) stocks, elevated
   winter temperatures (Celsius) 4-9-degrees above the ambient increased
   the degree of testicular resorption in previously mature male Atlantic
   salmon parr. Two-summer-old mature male parr maintained at a temperature
   9-degrees over the ambient for 5 mo (January-May) showed an increase in
   hypoosmoregulatory ability when challenged in seawater at the time of
   smoltification whereas parr kept at elevated temperature for various
   2-mo periods (january-February, February-March, or March-April) failed
   to show this improvement. Furthermore, previously mature males kept at
   an elevated winter water temperature for either 2 or 5 mo showed a lower
   incidence of sexual rematuration, and consequently a higher mean growth
   rate, after one summer in sea pens. A river release experiment showed
   that rearing previously mature males at 4-7-degrees above the ambient
   water temperature from December to April increased the number of
   downstream migrating fish to a level similar to that of immature smolts.
   We suggest the use of a simple method for enhancing the potential yield
   of ranched and cultured salmon from early maturing males by removing
   them from the stock population and rearing them over winter in heated
   water.},

Abstract = {Parental care in common eiders (Somateria mollissima) was studied during
   three field seasons in northern Norway. Forty-two percent of the females
   were found to abandon their brood. Abandonment and tending of broods and
   creches were not obligate individual strategies, but changed between
   years. Females abandoning their young laid smaller clutches and had a
   lower body weight at hatching than brood- and creche-tending females,
   indicating that they were in poor body condition. This supports the
   hypothesis that abandoning the brood is a salvage strategy in which
   energetic stress limits females' ability to care for their young. Young
   of ``abandoners{''} seemed to have a lower survival rate than young of
   ``tenders,{''} which suggests a reproductive cost of abandoning the
   young. Forty-seven percent of tagged ducklings were found with females
   other than their mother. Twenty-seven percent of the brood- and
   creche-tending females lost young to other females, but never more than
   one duckling. Adoptions of foreign ducklings, above the normal brood
   size of four, did not lead to greater parental effort, and duckling
   survival was similar among broods and creches of different sizes. This
   suggests that adoptions may be of neutral adaptive value. Two females
   often formed stable creches, but duckling survival was not significantly
   different from that in broods and creches with single females.},

Abstract = {Alcid species (auks) breed in a restricted number of large seabird
   colonies and are considered highly philopatric. Mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) of Common Murres, Uria aalge, from four Norwegian colonies was
   investigated by restriction analysis to assess the amount of geographic
   population structure and genetic variability in a colonial breeder.
   Eleven restriction endonucleases revealed 13 mtDNA genotypes among 51
   individuals. Genetic diversity was low, with an average of 0.11\% (range
   0.0-0.55\%) sequence divergence between all individuals. Population
   divergence within the surveyed region seems to be minimal, demonstrated
   by the low levels of sequence divergence between colonies and lack of
   spatial structuring of genotypes. Such results can be expected if birds
   originated from a smaller ancestral population during glaciation, and
   may have been reinforced by repeated population bottlenecks and
   considerable gene flow between colonies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {(1) A model is developed which aims to predict the twig size a browsing
   moose, Alces alces, should select during winter. We assume that moose
   should maximize the net energetic gain of foraging.
   (2) The model incorporates stochastic variation in the outcome of the
   choice. Due to physiognomy of the trees, the moose may be unable to make
   a perfect choice of the optimal twig size.
   (3) The stochastic version of the model predicts smaller optimal twig
   sizes than the deterministic version does. A comparison with the chosen
   twig size of birch Betula pubescens in a population in Central Norway
   shows that the model predicts quite well the selection of twigs.
   Furthermore, the stochastic version of the model gives a better fit to
   the data than the deterministic model does.
   (4) The tree species a temperature browsing herbivore encounters during
   winter may differ in shape and in the relationship between the
   properties of the twig (e.g. energetic content, digestibility) and twig
   size. The sensitivity of the optimal clip diameter to variations in
   those parameters was examined by numerical analyses. These simulations
   showed that optimal twig size was most sensitive to (i) variation in the
   relationship between digestibility and diameter, and (ii) the encounter
   rate of twigs.
   (5) The impact of browsing on the plant is likely to be closely
   correlated with the amount of biomass removed. These analyses suggest
   that plant species which have a few large annual shoots of high quality
   will be, at the same available biomass, more severely affected by
   herbivores than species with smaller annual shoots of lower
   digestibility.
   (6) The simulations suggest that an increase in the number of shoots
   produced in response to browsing may be an adaptation to reduce the
   impact of further browsing by modifying the herbivore's foraging
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the genetic consequences of aquaculture on natural
   fish populations. The study is motivated by rapidly increasing numbers
   of intentionally and accidentally released fish and is based on
   empirical observations reported in the literature. A wide variety of
   outcomes, ranging from no detectable effect to complete introgression or
   displacement, has been observed following releases of cultured fish into
   natural settings. Where genetic effects on performance traits have been
   documented, they always appear to be negative in comparison with the
   unaffected native populations. These findings are consistent with
   theoretical considerations of the implications of elevated levels of
   gene flow between cultured and locally adapted natural populations; they
   raise concerns over the genetic future of many natural populations in
   the light of increasing numbers of released fish. Strategies for the
   genetic protection of native populations from the effects of aquaculture
   are outlined including more secure containment, the use of sterilized
   fish, and modifying the points of rearing and release. We recommend
   strong restrictions on gene flow from cultured to wild populations and
   effective monitoring of such gene flow.},

   that has been unchanged since 5000 B.P. despite a deterioration in the
   quality of their winter range through the loss of high quality pine
   forests.
   (3) The low calf production of the GV population (0.6 calves per cow
   greater-than-or-equal-to 2 years), compared with neighbouring
   populations (0.79-1.27 calves per cow greater-than-or-equal-to 2 years)
   are likely to reflect poor winter ranges.
   (4) Migratory traditions in moose appear to log behind environmental
   changes, and changing migratory routes to utilise better quality range
   may take many generations.},

   salaris: exposure of uninfected eels to infected salmon; exposure of
   infected eels to uninfected salmon; exposure of uninfected eels to
   infected eels; indirect infection of uninfected eels; parasite
   transmission preference, using ``two-choice{''} host tests; and parasite
   survival on eels following thier isolation. Gyrodactylus salaris was
   found to be transmissible from salmon to eels, and vice versa, both at 4
   and 13-degrees-C. Eel to eel transfer of G. salaris was also
   demonstrated, as was infected of fish from the bottom of the tank.
   Transmission of G. salaris to eels also occurred in the ``two-choice{''}
   host tests. Transmission rate was positively correlated with water
   temperature and transmission was more frequent from dead than living
   infected salmon. The maximum duration of infection on eels was 8 days.
   The transfer of infection to eels is thought to parallel events in
   nature and forms part of the dispersal mechanism of G. salaris.},

Volume = {116},

Abstract = {Responses of 33 potential host species towards a non-mimetic, dummy,
   cuckoo egg placed in their nest were tested (N = 372).  For 22 of these
   species, their behavioural responses towards a dummy cuckoo placed near
   their nest were also tested (N = 193). The species were grouped in A)
   most common hosts:  species which at the moment are losing out in the
   coevolutionary arms race with the cuckoo and which today represent
   favorite hosts; B) frequently-used hosts:  species which at the moment
   are assumed to be true cuckoo hosts, but which are not so commonly used
   as those in group A; C) rarely-used hosts:  species which would appear
   to be suitable hosts, but which despite of this, are rarely used.  These
   species are assumed to be ahead of the cuckoo in the coevolutionary arms
   race; D) unsuitable hosts:  species with a breeding biology which either
   prevents, or counteracts, cuckoo parasitism.  They are therefore assumed
   never to have been engaged in a coevolutionary arms race with the
   cuckoo.
   In the most common hosts the median acceptance rate of the non-mimetic
   egg was 86\%, in the frequently-used hosts 33\%, in the rarely-used
   hosts 10\% and in the unsuitable hosts 100\%.  In the most common hosts
   the median rate of aggression shown towards the cuckoo dummy was 50\%,
   but the most numerous species in this group, the meadow pipit, showed
   aggressive behaviour in 60\% of the cases.  The median aggression rate
   both in the frequently-used hosts and the rare hosts was 100\% and in
   the unsuitable hosts 0\%.  The bluethroat was the only species which
   accepted the non-mimetic dummy egg at a higher rate later on during the
   incubation period than during earlier stages.  A positive correlation
   was found between the power of egg discrimination and the rate of
   aggression shown towards the dummy cuckoo.  Such aggression was stronger
   when both parents were present at the nest than when only one parent was
   present.
   The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that the
   differences in the degree of responses by the host species towards
   parasitism by the cuckoo reflect different stages in a continuous
   coevolutionary arms race with cuckoos.},

Abstract = {Information on the Norwegian population on Canada geese was collected
   through geese counts, wildlife management files, and questionnaires and
   interviews with local and central wildlife authorities. A small number
   of geese was first introduced to Norway in 1936. The population remained
   on a very low level until release activity increased in the 1960s. At
   least 787 geese were released or transferred to new areas during
   1971-1984. However, the whole Scandinavian population originates from
   two very small founder populations. Breeding populations were
   established in 16 of the 19 Norwegian counties, lacking only in one
   inland county in Southern Norway and in the two northernmost counties by
   1984. Average annual per cent increase in brood number was 25\% in
   1971-81 and 27\% in 1981-83. Number of breeding pairs and autumn
   population size was significantly positively correlated with number of
   previously released geese indicating that geographical distribution and
   number of geese was much influenced by regional release intensity. The
   population increased considerably through breeding in the wild. The
   population in 1984 was estimated to consist of 700-900 breeding pairs
   and an autumn population of 5000-7000 individuals. The numbers seem to
   have continued to increase after 1984.},

Abstract = {Twenty enzyme loci were investigated using starch gel electrophoresis in
   managed populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and sika deer (C.
   nippon) from Ireland. The red deer, which originated from several
   European countries, were polymorphic (\%P) at 25\% of the loci examined
   and exhibited a mean heterozygosity (HBAR) of 0.025. The sika,
   originally from Japan, were introduced to Ireland in very limited
   numbers. Here, \%P was 5\% and HBAR was 0.006. Mean genetic distance
   (DBAR) between these taxa was 0.160. Because Scottish red deer, the
   source of much of the Irish herd, had previously been investigated for
   16 of the same enzyme loci, it was possible to merge the present data
   with results from that earlier study, which also included North American
   wapiti (C. elaphus canadensis). The resulting phenogram based on genetic
   distance demonstrates that sika are twice as distantly related to red
   deer and wapiti, than the latter are to each other and suggests that
   sika-like forms are ancestral. Also, the demonstration of absolute
   mobility differences in the products of two enzyme loci in red deer and
   sika has many practical applications.},

Abstract = {Accurate measurements of the recruitment levels into any fish stock are
   essential for the successful management of that stock.  Pollachius
   virens is an important commercial species in Norway but accurate
   determinations of the fecundity rate of the stock are nearly unfeasible.
   This is due to the inshore habitat of the youngest year classes of the
   species where they evade capture in traditional sampling gear.  This
   paper proposes annual analyses of Phalacrocorax aristotelis summer prey
   harvest as a supplement to data collected during traditional fisheries
   surveys.},

Abstract = {Two species of freshwater cyclopoid copepods, Cyclops scutifer Sars and
   Mesocyclops leuckarti (Claus), with different ecological requirements,
   coexist in three humic ponds near the timberline in boreal forests in
   south-central Norway.  The life cycle in both species is basically
   regulated by complete depletion of oxygen during the long winter.  There
   is a short period of reproduction in spring followed by a rapid
   development during summer and autumn to advanced instars, capable of
   diapause when oxygen depletion starts in early winter.  Both species
   have an exclusive 1-yr cycle.
   The long winter under anoxic conditions is passed in diapause as large
   copepodids (late developmental instars) with usually no individuals left
   in the plankton.
   Even if co-occurring in the same habitats with similar life cycles,
   there is a temporal and spatial segregation.},

Abstract = {Exploitation rates in different sea fisheries were estimated by tag
   returns of Atlantic salmon released as hatchery-reared smolts in the
   River Drammenselv, SE Norway, 1984-1986.  The salmon were exploited in
   distant fisheries at the Faroes and Greenland, in marine fisheries in
   Norwegian home waters and in the River Drammenselv.  The exploitation
   rate of these fish was low at Greenland, moderate at the Faroes and
   relatively high in Norwegian home waters.  However, the exploitation
   rate in home waters was lower than for other Norwegian salmon stocks. 
   Exploitation within the River Drammenselv was estimated by combining
   catch statistics, counts of ascending fish in a salmon ladder and
   mark-recapture experiments downstream from the ladder.  From 1985 to
   1988, the rod exploitation rates varied between 0.33 and 0.53.},

Abstract = {A total of 10,650 Purple Sandpipers were counted on small islands and
   skerries off the outer coast of Troms and 953 were counted on 220 km of
   fjord coastline.  The total wintering population in the study area was
   estimated at about 18,000.  Seven samples of Purple Sandpipers were
   cannon-netted during early November 1988.  There were differences in age
   and sex structure between localities.  The overall bias towards males
   (60\%) was believed to be due to the females being elsewhere rather than
   caused by greater mortality among females.  Adult birds were heavier
   than first-year birds and Norwegian birds were heavier than Scottish
   birds.  Of adult males 31\% and of females 10\% were still moulting
   primaries in November.  Site fidelity within and between winters was
   recorded.  The population is thought to be composed of birds which breed
   in the U.S.S.R.},

Year = {1990},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The aims of this paper are to detect floristic variation within
   different types of tall-fern dominated vegetation and to interpret these
   patterns in terms of environmental variables. Numerical approaches have
   been applied to a large and varied vegetational data-set with associated
   environmental data from stands dominated by Athyrium distentifolium,
   Thelypteris limbosperma, and Matteuccia struthiopteris in different
   parts of western Norway. The numerical procedures of two-way indicator
   species analysis, simple discriminant functions, and canonical
   correspondence analysis have been used, and the strengths and weaknesses
   of these as tools in discerning vegetational-environmental relationships
   are discussed. For each of the 96 quadrats investigated, 17
   environmental variables were measured. The investigation shows that some
   of the observed differences in vegetational composition can be explained
   in terms of relatively simple soil and climatic variables measured for
   each quadrat. The ferns appear to be ecologically well separated. T.
   limbosperma-dominated stands are mainly characterised by low soil
   fertility, high January temperature, and high humidity. A.
   distentifolium-dominated stands are associated with low winter
   temperatures, and M. struthiopteris-dominated stands have high soil
   fertility and high summer temperatures.},

Abstract = {Acidification in geologically-sensitive areas subject to appreciable
   acidic deposition has affected the activities of microbes, plants and
   animals in poorly-buffered freshwater ecosystems in Europe and N.
   America.  Biota can be influenced directly by changes in water quality
   during both short acidic episodes and longer-term sustained periods of
   acidification:  they are affected indirectly by alterations to the
   balance of acid-sensitive and acid-tolerant species at different trophic
   levels sometimes leading to a lessening of grazing pressures.  Together
   the chemical and biological alterations result in adverse effects on
   some biogeochemical processes including the increased mobilisation and
   leaching of biologically active elements such as mercury, copper and
   zinc.  Many field observations have now been corroborated by field
   (whole-lake) and laboratory experiments.
   Decomposition of organic matter, attributable to microbes, has been
   found to be affected adversely at some locations.  Conspicuously,
   acidification favours the prolific growth of filamentous algae
   particularly species of Mougeotia:  it also shifts the balance of
   diatoms, minimising the occurrence of circumneutral species and
   favouring that of acidophilous and acidobiontic types.  Because of their
   `resistant' siliceous skeletons, it has been possible to trace the
   historical progression of acidification by examining the remains of
   diatoms in sediment accumulations.  While their species diversity is
   significantly decreased, the biomass and productivity of dinoflagellates
   and chrysophytes are only slightly affected.
   Like that of phytoplankton (dinoflagellates, chrysophytes and some
   diatoms), the species diversity of zooplankton is significantly
   decreased by acidification which has variable effects on the biomass and
   productivity of the group as a whole:  the loss of daphnids is
   particularly conspicuous.  Of the benthic macroinvertebrates, snails,
   crayfish, clams and freshwater shrimps (amphipods) have been found to be
   acid-sensitive whereas dragonflies and water boatmen (corixids)
   increase, particularly where populations of predetory fish have
   decreased.
   Acidification has been responsible for the loss of fish from significant
   parts of Norway and Sweden:  losses, partial or complete, have also been
   documented in geologically-sensitive areas of the U.K. and other parts
   of Europe, also Canada and the U.S.A.  Eels seem to be the least
   sensitive to acidic conditions, followed by pike, trout, minnow and
   roach - the latter being the most sensitive.  Prior to being eliminated,
   populations of fish become unbalanced because of recruitment failure and
   the mean age, and sometimes size, of the survivors increases. 
   Accumulations of manganese and mercury have been detected in fish taken
   from acidified freshwaters.  Short-term events (episodes) of extreme
   acidity and/or large concentrations of water-soluble aluminium have led
   to major fish kills.
   The development of embryonic and larval stages of amphibians, including
   the common frog, toad and natterjack toad, is acid-sensitive.  The
   distribution of fish-eating birds may be influenced by the effects of
   acidification on the performance of their prey.  That of the dipper, a
   riverine bird, as well as its breeding success, has been restricted
   where acidification has decreased the availability of its
   macroinvertebrate prey.  Deleterious effects on fish-eating mammals of
   reduced supplies of prey, sometimes with accumulations of mercury and
   cadmium and attributable directly and indirectly to acidification, have
   not, as yet, been confirmed.},
