Abstract = {We assessed the potential impacts of land-use changes resulting from a
   change in the current biofuel policy on biodiversity in Europe. We
   evaluated the possible impact of both arable and woody biofuel crops on
   changes in distribution of 313 species pertaining to different taxonomic
   groups. Using species-specific information on habitat suitability as
   well as land use simulations for three different biofuel policy options,
   we downscaled available species distribution data from the original
   resolution of 50 to 1 km. The downscaled maps were then applied to
   analyse potential changes in habitat size and species composition at
   different spatial levels. Our results indicate that more species might
   suffer from habitat losses rather than benefit from a doubled biofuel
   target, while abolishing the biofuel target would mainly have positive
   effects. However, the possible impacts vary spatially and depend on the
   biofuel crop choice, with woody crops being less detrimental than arable
   crops. Our results give an indication for policy and decision makers of
   what might happen to biodiversity under a changed biofuel policy in the
   European Union. The presented approach is considered to be innovative as
   to date no comparable policy impact assessment has been applied to such
   a large set of key species at the European scale.},

Title = {Timber import and the risk of forest pest introductions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-63},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many invasive species are introduced by trade, and there is a need for
   studies of pre-emptive measures to lower the risk of introductions, as
   post-establishment management is often extremely costly or nearly
   impossible.
   In this study, we present a generic model for the first step of the
   invasion process for trade-imported pests, and further develop this
   model for potentially harmful bark beetles to assess the risk of
   introductions and alternative management options.
   Our results suggest that introductions of bark beetles are likely, given
   present timber import practices, and that immigration may often go
   undetected by pheromone traps.
   The most effective measures for reducing introduction risk were those
   aimed at isolating the storage from forest (storage enclosure, location)
   followed by those reducing the available resources for forest pests
   (debarking, timber irrigation, rapid processing), whereas delayed import
   was least effective.
   Synthesis and applications: The generic model framework of species
   introductions presented here may easily be adapted to other import
   systems. The submodels of population dynamics and dispersal are also
   quite general, and we expect our qualitative results to hold in many
   cases, although the models were parameterized for bark beetles in this
   study. Our results suggest that detection of dispersal from storage to
   forests will be difficult, which implies that management actions should
   not be deferred until after detection in nature, as the pest species may
   then already be established and eradication may be too late. However,
   pre-emptive measures reducing propagule pressure at one or several
   stages of the introduction process, in particular isolation measures,
   may strongly reduce introduction risk.},

Title = {Environmental service payments: Evaluating biodiversity conservation
   trade-offs and cost-efficiency in the Osa Conservation Area, Costa Rica},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {90},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The cost-efficiency of payments for environmental services (PES) to
   private landowners in the Osa Conservation Area, Costa Rica, is
   evaluated in terms of the trade-off between biodiversity representation
   and opportunity costs of conservation to agricultural and forestry
   land-use. Using available GIS data and an `off-the-shelf' software
   application called TARGET, we find that the PES allocation criteria
   applied by authorities in 2002-2003 were more than twice as
   cost-efficient as criteria applied during 1999-2001. Results show that a
   policy relevant assessment of the cost-effectiveness of PES relative to
   other conservation policies can be carried Out at regional level using
   available Studies and GIS data. However, there are a number of data and
   conceptual limitations to using heuristic optimisation algorithms in the
   analysis of the cost-efficiency of PES. Site specific data on
   probabilities of land-use change, and a detailed specification of
   opportunity costs of firm land, labour and capital are required to use
   algorithms such as TARGET for ranking individual sites based on
   cost-efficiency. Despite its conceptual Soundness for regional
   conservation analysis, biodiversity complementarity presents a practical
   challenge as a criterion for PES eligibility at farm level because it
   varies depending on the Set Of areas under PES contracts at any one
   time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Migratory timing, marine survival and growth of anadromous brown trout

Year = {2009},
Volume = {74},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper was to study sea migration, growth and survival of
   brown trout Salmo trutta of the River Imsa, 1976-2005. The migratory S.
   trutta were individually tagged and fish leaving or entering the river
   were monitored daily in traps located near the river mouth. The mean
   annual duration of the sea sojourn was 6-9 months for first-time
   migrants moving to sea between January and June. It was 8-18 months for
   those migrating to sea between July and December. Veteran migrants
   stayed 12 months or less at sea and most returned to the river in
   August. Early ascending fish stayed the longest in fresh water because
   most returned to sea in April to May. The day number of 50\% cumulative
   smolt descent correlated negatively with mean water temperature in
   February to March and the February North Atlantic Oscillation index
   (NAOI). Mean annual sea growth during the first 2 years after smolting
   was higher for S. trutta spending the winter at sea than those wintering
   in the River Imsa. First year's sea growth was lower for S. trutta
   descending in spring than autumn. For first-time migrants, it correlated
   negatively with the February NAOI of the smolt year. Sea survival was
   higher for spring than autumn descending first-time migratory S. trutta
   with a maximum in May (14.9\%). Number of anadromous S. trutta returning
   to the river increased linearly with the size of the cohort moving to
   sea, with no evidence of density-dependent sea mortality. Sea survival
   of S. trutta smolts moving to sea between January and June correlated
   positively both with the annual number of Atlantic Salmo salar smolts,
   the specific growth rate at sea, and time of seaward migration in
   spring. This is the first study indicating how environmental factors at
   the time of seaward migration influence the sea survival of S. trutta.},

Title = {Above ground biomass changes in the mountain birch forests and mountain

Abstract = {Birch forests cover large areas of the northern Fennoscandia and the
   mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) often forming the
   altitudinal and Arctic forest and tree lines. Interpreting the factors
   leading to landscape changes in mountain birch forest involves
   disturbance from anthropogenic use and climate as important factors.
   Using vegetation maps based on aerial photographs and satellite images
   from 7 years in combination with statistical data and ground estimation
   data of biomass in the period 1957-2006, we were able to assess the
   transitions among mountain heaths and different types of forest, the
   displacement of the altitudinal forest line and hence the change in
   biomass. The tree biomass as well as the growing stock for birch in
   Finnmarksvidda doubled in the period 1957-2006. Only lichen biomass has
   been significantly reduced in the period 1957 to 2000, with a subsequent
   slight increase of lichen biomass in the period 2000 to 2006. The
   results presented in this paper show significant and positive
   relationships between measured tree biomass and the increase in reindeer
   population in the period 1957-2006 in the study area. The hypothesis
   concerning the removal of the ``lichen barrier effect{''} by heavy
   reindeer grazing which leads to increased success for birch seeds to
   germinate and sprout is therefore considered to be valid. However, also,
   climate change effects like increased precipitation, moth attacks,
   freezing and thawing events during winter and long-transported air
   pollution (e.g. nitrogen) may also have reinforced the changes in
   biomass. Climatic variables from regional weather stations for the
   period 1955-2006 did not, however, reveal any consistent change except
   for that the increased snow depth had a negative impact on the reindeer
   population while increase in snow depth hindering the reindeer in
   grazing seemed to have a positive impact on the lichen biomass. The
   ongoing development of increased forest cover and hence elevated forest
   line will lead to reduction of open habitats, and hence decreased
   grazing accessibility for the reindeer. The effects on forestry and
   carbon sequestration are also discussed, and here one of the suggestions
   is to let the northern birch forests act as carbon sinks contributing to
   the reduction of total net emission Of CO2 in the Nordic countries. Land
   use like reindeer husbandry has shown to strongly affect relationships
   between ecological processes like tree-growth and climate. Moreover,
   reindeer husbandry is such a widespread human activity in the arctic and
   boreal region that it might affect the global carbon budget (C) 2008

Title = {Potential benefit of clove oil sedation on animal welfare during salmon

Journal = {AQUACULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {40},

Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of clove oil (4.0
   mg L(-1)) sedation, compared with non-sedation, on the primary (plasma
   cortisol), secondary (osmoregulation) and tertiary (mortality) stress
   responses in Atlantic salmon smolts during transport and transfer to
   sea. Clove oil sedation during on- and off-loading sufficiently reduced
   the primary stress response to lower mortality (2.1\%) during transfer
   to sea compared with unsedated fish, which experienced a mortality rate
   above 12.2\%. The unsedated fish experienced an acute mortality that
   stabilized only 6 days after the transport. None of the secondary stress
   responses measured in this experiment could contribute towards
   explaining this phenomenon, with the possible exception of plasma
   magnesium (Mg(2+)). Plasma Mg(2+) differed between the groups; while
   plasma Mg(2+) in the clove oil sedated group returned to pre-stress
   levels 72 h after transport, the unsedated group showed no such recovery
   even 1 week after transport, which may indicate a disturbance in the
   hydromineral balance, and provides a plausible explanation for the
   delayed mortality in this group. Eugenol-based anaesthetics appear to be

Title = {Multiple mating and a low incidence of cuckoldry for nest-holding males
   in the two-spotted goby, Gobiusculus flavescens},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: A major question in behavioural ecology concerns the
   relationship between genetic mating systems and the strength of sexual
   selection. In this study, we investigated the genetic mating system of
   the two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens), a useful fish model for
   the study of sexual selection whose genetic mating system remains
   uncharacterized. We developed four polymorphic microsatellite markers
   and used them to conduct parentage analyses on 21 nests collected during
   the breeding season to examine the rates of multiple mating by males and
   to test for evidence of alternative mating strategies.
   Results: Results of this study indicate that male G. flavescens mate
   with multiple females and enjoy confidence of paternity. We detected
   only one instance of sneaking, so cuckoldry contributed a very small
   percentage (similar to 0.1\%) of the total fertilizations in this
   population. Nests were nearly full and males that maintain larger nests
   have higher mating and reproductive success, irrespective of body size.
   Conclusion: Overall, our investigation shows that G. flavescens is
   similar to other, related gobies in that the nests of care-giving males
   often contain eggs from multiple females. However, G. flavescens differs
   from other gobies in displaying an extremely low rate of cuckoldry. The
   study of ecological factors responsible for this important difference
   between G. flavescens and related species should be a fertile area for
   future work.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal distribution of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) with
   intact and blocked olfactory sense during the spawning season in a
   Norwegian fjord with intensive salmon farming},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {286},

Abstract = {In several areas along the Norwegian coast local fishermen claim that
   wild migrating Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L) have changed their spawning
   migratory behaviour following establishment of salmon farms, and no
   longer enter their natural spawning grounds in the fjords. This has
   created a heated debate in Norway and, in some areas, passed down a
   moratorium on establishing new salmon farms. Research has so far not
   been able to show a causal connection, but it has been suggested that
   water-soluble odorants from high density salmon stocks in commercial
   fish farms might be responsible for the avoidance of areas with fish
   farming and abandonment of nearby traditional spawning grounds. The aim
   of this study was to test this hypothesis by studying the spatiotemporal
   distribution of wild migrating cod tagged with acoustic transmitters
   using an array of automatic listening stations in Oksfjord, a Norwegian
   fjord with intensive fish farming and traditional spawning grounds for
   cod. The tagged cod were released either in the outer parts of Oksfjord,
   i.e. in the area they were caught, or in the inner part of the fjord
   close to their traditional spawning areas. The olfactory sense was
   physically blocked for 50\% of the fish. Only one cod released in the
   outer part of the fjord visited the traditional spawning grounds. The
   majority of the cod that were released in the inner part of the fjord
   remained in this area for approximately three weeks before they left the
   fjord. There were no differences in spatiotemporal distribution between
   cod with intact and cod with blocked olfactory sense. Thus, the results
   provided no evidence that migrating wild cod avoid areas with fish
   farming as a response to odorants, but the results do not per se
   contradict the fishermen's observation that coastal cod have changed
   their migratory pattern in this fjord. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Sexual selection theory predicts that females should choose males that
   signal viability and quality. However, few studies have found fitness
   benefits among females mating with highly ornamented males. Here, we use
   Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), a teleost fish with no parental care,
   to investigate whether females could gain fitness benefits by mating
   with highly ornamented and large-sized males. Carotenoid-based
   coloration signalled by males during spawning is believed to be an
   indicator of good genes for this species. Paternal effects on offspring
   size (body length and dry body mass) were examined experimentally by
   crossing eggs and sperm in vitro from 12 females and 24 males in a
   split-brood design and raising larvae to 30 days past hatching. We
   clearly demonstrated that there was a relationship between offspring
   size and paternal coloration. However, a negative interaction between
   paternal length and coloration was evident for offspring length,
   indicating that positive effects of paternal coloration were only
   present for smaller males. Thus, the red spawning coloration of the male
   Arctic charr seems to be an indicator of good genes, but the effect of
   paternal coloration on offspring length, an indicator of `offspring
   quality', is size dependent.},

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},

Volume = {173},

Abstract = {In seasonal environments, timing of reproduction is an important fitness
   component. However, in ungulates, our understanding of this biological
   process is limited. Here we analyze how age and body mass affect
   spatiotemporal variation in timing of ovulation of 6,178 Norwegian
   moose. We introduced a parametric statistical model to obtain inferences
   about the seasonal timing of ovulation peak, the degree of synchrony
   among individuals, and the proportion of individuals that ovulate. These
   components showed much more spatiotemporal variation than previously
   reported. Young ( primiparous) and old (>= 11.5 years of age) females
   ovulated later than prime-aged (2.5-10.5 years of age) females. In all
   age classes, ovulation was delayed with decreasing body mass. Ovulation
   rates were lower and more variable among primiparous females than among
   older females. Young females required higher body mass than older
   females did to ovulate. The body-mass-to-ovulation relationship varied
   with age, showed large regional variation, and differed among years
   within region. These results suggest that ( 1) environmental and
   population characteristics contribute to shape seasonal variation in the
   breeding pattern and ( 2) large regional variation exists in the
   size-dependent age at maturity in moose. Hence, the life-history
   trade-off between reproduction and body growth should differ regionally
   in moose.},

   herbivory},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Pages = {466-474},
Abstract = {Grazing by large herbivores, in interplay with environmental
   productivity, is a key driver of the composition of the vegetation with
   important consequences on the ecosystem and, consequently, for land
   management. We tested the predictions of the resource availability -
   resource-acquisition theory by assessing the extent to which community
   averages of plant traits, known to be related to plant growth,
   competitive ability and response to grazing were correlated with
   resource gradients within local (200 km(2)) geographical ranges. Second,
   we assessed the applicability of the same set of plant traits to make
   inferences on ecological effects of grazing by sheep in alpine
   ecosystems in Norway, using a data set consisting of 16 sites in central
   Norway. We estimated grazing intensity by free-ranging sheep based on
   GPS telemetry, soil properties, plant species composition and species
   traits i.e. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC),
   leaf size and plant height. Soil fertility and the interaction between
   soil fertility and grazing, but not grazing intensity alone, were
   significantly related to plant species and traits composition.
   Generally, average SLA showed lower correspondence with soil fertility
   and grazing than the other traits. Leaf size and plant height were
   lowest at sites with high grazing intensity and in sites with low
   fertility, and increased with soil fertility in little and moderately
   grazed sites, but declined at high fertility sites when grazing was
   intense. LDMC showed the opposite trend. Grazing intensity was more
   related to the variability in plant composition and average plant traits
   when environmental productivity was high. Our results therefore are
   indicative of a convergence of responses to grazing and nutrient
   limitation. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Structurally complex landscapes and organic management have been shown
   to augment natural pest enemy populations on arable land. Here, body
   condition and reproductive capacity of wolf spiders were studied to see

   (relative female weight) and fecundity (number of offspring and relative
   egg sac weight) were measured for each captured spider. In contrast to
   the hypothesis, Pardosa females caught in fields situated in landscapes
   dominated by large fields of annual crops had superior body condition.
   Farming practice had no effect on either body condition or fecundity
   measures. It is suggested that increased spider body condition in
   homogeneous landscapes may be due to less competition for available
   resources, although temporal variation should be included before drawing
   final conclusions on spiders' body condition in the agricultural
   landscape. (c) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Populations of rare or elusive large mammals are difficult to monitor,
   because they usually are secretive, solitary, occur at low densities,
   and have large home ranges. The global trend of generally decreasing
   large carnivore populations necessitates new, feasible, reliable, and
   cost-effective monitoring methods. We evaluate an index method developed
   for monitoring populations of moose (Alces alces) based on voluntarily
   and systematically collected observations from hunters, corrected for
   effort, for use in monitoring populations of large carnivores in Sweden.
   For our evaluation, we used independent estimates of minimum brown bear
   (Ursus arctos) densities from DNA-based scat surveys and brown bear
   distribution from mandatory reports from successful bear hunters. We
   verified that the index correctly reflected bear distribution. We also
   found strong linear relationships between the indices and the
   independent density estimates for bears at the scale of local management
   units (about 1000-2000 km(2)) in all three regional study areas
   (adjusted R-2 = 0.88-0.60). Our results suggest that systematic,
   effort-corrected reports of observed animals can be an alternative and
   accurate monitoring method for the conservation and management of large
   mammals occurring over large areas when large numbers of willing
   volunteers are available (effort >30,000 h). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Evaluating capture stress and its effects on reproductive success in
   Svalbard reindeer},
Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although many ecological studies of wild animal populations rely on
   capturing individuals at least once, few have investigated either the
   immediate stress responses of capture, restraint, and handling, or the
   longer term consequences on reproductive success. In this paper, we
   assume that the degree of stress increase with the time taken to capture
   and process an animal prior to release. The influence of time since
   onset of capture on body temperature and blood chemistry indicators of
   stress was investigated in 137 adult female Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer
   tarandus platyrhynchus Vrolik, 1829) and 63 calves of both sexes
   captured by net in late-winter 2004 and 2005. In addition, we looked for
   evidence of negative effects of capture stress on reproductive success
   in marked animals over the period from 1995 to 2006. Body temperature
   increased with both chase time and the time the animals were restrained.
   In the latter case, body temperature increased twice as fast in
   nonpregnant animals (0.13 degrees C/min) compared with pregnant animals.
   Cortisol, glutamate dehydrogenase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase all
   increased with time from onset of capture. However, the relationship for
   glucose with time since onset of capture increased initially before
   declining again. We found no evidence of a lower calving success in
   animals captured the previous winter when compared with animals that had
   not been captured the previous winter. Likewise, there was no
   relationship between the strength of the acute stress response (
   measured as cortisol concentrations) and the probability of pregnant
   females having a calf at foot the subsequent summer.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {3, 19},
Pages = {275-286},
Abstract = {The study area of Fermoscandia is a heterogeneous climatic region. To
   map the linear trends in onset, end, and length of the growing season in
   Fermoscandia, the bimonthly Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping
   Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) satellite
   data set was used. The data set has an 8 x 8 km(2) spatial resolution
   and covers the period from 1982 to 2006. The mapping was done by
   applying pixel-specific threshold values to the NDVI data. These
   threshold values were determined from surface phenology data on birch
   Betula pubescens from 28 stations across the study area. During spring,
   most stations showed a moderately strong positive correlation between
   field and NDVI data. However, mapping of the end of the growing season
   showed less correlation with field phenology data and presented some
   uncertainty. On average, there was a linear trend for all of
   Fermoscandia of a 0.27 d yr(-1) earlier onset of the growing season, a
   0.37 d yr(-1) later end of the growing season, and a 0.64 d yr(-1)
   longer growing season. Within Fermoscandia, the trends showed
   similarities with vegetation zones and sections, which reflect the
   climatic gradients from north to south and from west to east in the
   study area. The southern and oceanic regions showed a trend of about a 1
   d yr(-1) longer growing season, in contrast to the alpine and northern
   continental regions which showed either no trend or a slightly shorter
   growing season.},

Abstract = {We investigated the impact from dietary OC (organochlorine) exposure and
   restricted feeding (emaciation) on bone mineral density (BMD: g
   hydroxy-apatite cm(-2)) in femoral, vertebrate, skull and baculum
   osteoid tissue from farmed Arctic blue foxes (Vulpes lagopus). For
   femur, also biomechanical properties during bending (displacement
   {[}mm], load IN], energy absorption HI and stiffness {[}N/mm]) were
   measured. Sixteen foxes (EXP) were fed a wet food containing 7.7\%
   OC-polluted minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) blubber in two
   periods of body fat deposition (Aug-Dec) and two periods of body fat
   mobilisation (Jan-July) in which the food contained less energy and only
   2\% blubber. Sigma OC food concentration in the food containing 7.7\%
   whale blubber was 309 ng/g wet mass. This corresponded to a Sigma OC
   exposure of ca. 17 mu g/kg body mass/d and a responding Sigma OC residue
   in subcutaneous adipose tissue of ca. 1700 ng/g live mass in the 8 EXP
   fat foxes euthanized after 16 months. A control group (CON) composed of
   15 foxes were fed equal daily caloric amounts of clean pork (Sus scrofa)
   fat. After 16 months, 8 EXP and 7 CON foxes were euthanized (mean body
   mass= 9.25 kg) while the remaining 8 EXP and 8 CON foxes were given
   restricted food rations for 6 months resulting in a body weight
   reduction (mean body mass=5.46 kg). The results showed that only
   BMDskull vs. BMDvertebrae were significantly correlated (R=0.68; p=0.03;
   n= 10) probably due to a similar composition of trabecular and cortical
   osteoid tissue. No difference in any of the BMD measurements or femoral
   biomechanical properties was found between EXP and CON foxes although
   BMD baculum was 1.6-folds lower in the EXP group. However, lean summer
   foxes had significantly lower femoral biomechanical properties measured
   as displacement (mm), energy absorption U) and time (s) biomechanical
   properties than fat winter foxes (all p < 0.004). This indicates lower
   stiffness and softer bones from fasting which is in agreement with
   previous studies. Further, it should be kept in mind when studying bone
   tissues in Arctic mammals also in order to avoid confounding effects
   from body condition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reproduction and survival of tawny owls in relation to persistent
   organic pollutants},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {The potential effects of organochlorines (OCs) and brominated flame
   retardants on reproduction and survival were studied in tawny owls
   (Strix aluco) in Central Norway over a period of 19 years (1986-2004).
   Concentrations of 14 OCs and five polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)
   were measured in eggs (n = 104), and Principal Component Analysis was
   used to produce composite measurements of pollutants: i.e. PC1 and PC2,
   which accounted for 85\% of the variation in contaminant concentrations.
   There was no evidence for adverse associations between pollutants (PC
   scores) and life-history traits such as clutch size, probability of
   producing fledglings and survival, when controlling for potentially
   confounding variables. Moreover, there was no evidence for interactions
   between pollutants and vole abundance suggesting no synergistic effects
   of food stress and pollutants on these life-history traits. There was.
   however, some evidence for a non-linear negative association between
   p,p'-DDE (1,1-dichloro-2.2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene) and eggshell
   thickness. This suggests that the concentrations of pollutants in this
   ecosystem were too low to affect reproduction and survival in an owl
   predominantly consuming prey at low trophic levels, but may be
   sufficient to cause eggshell thinning at the highest concentrations. (C)

Title = {Resource partitioning in sympatric arctic-breeding geese: summer habitat
   use, spatial and dietary overlap of Barnacle and Pink-footed Geese in
   Svalbard},
Journal = {IBIS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {151},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The spatial, habitat and dietary overlap of two breeding goose species
   was studied in Sassendalen, Svalbard, in summer 2003 based on abundance
   within 500 x 500-m grid squares and faecal diet analyses during
   pre-breeding, nesting and post-hatching periods. More than half of all
   Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus occurred in the absence of
   Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis during nesting and post-hatching periods
   compared to c. 20\% when concentrated by pre-breeding snow cover. In
   contrast, only 5\% of Barnacle Geese were observed in the absence of
   Pink-footed Geese pre-breeding, 15\% during nesting, and 35\%
   post-hatching. Among six defined habitat types, Barnacle Geese resorted
   more to `upland' habitats during pre-breeding and nesting and to lowland
   lakes post-hatching when compared to Pink-footed Geese. Although
   Pink-footed Geese showed less change in seasonal habitat preference,
   many shifted to the river valley bottom post-hatching, giving access to
   open water (predator avoidance) and lush green vegetation (foraging for
   goslings). The smallest extent of distributional overlap between the two
   species occurred post-hatching, but each species was also highly
   restricted by snow cover during pre-nesting. The greatest extent of
   overlap in distribution and diet occurred during incubation, when large
   dietary variation between different breeding valleys reflected local
   food availability around nests (probably a result of nest-site
   preference rather than food selection per se). Whether this means that
   increased interactions within and between the two goose species with
   future increases in local density are most likely to be manifest at this
   stage of the summer is impossible to determine without knowledge of
   available food resources and manipulative experiments. More detailed
   investigations of the effects of foraging by both species on plant
   structure, quality and community composition are necessary to predict
   likely outcomes of future changes in population densities of both
   species.},

Title = {Spatial distribution of limited resources and local density regulation

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {226-235},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity of resources may influence competition among
   individuals and thus have a fundamental role in shaping population
   dynamics and carrying capacity. In the present study, we identify
   shelter opportunities as a limiting resource for juvenile Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar L.). Experimental and field studies are combined in
   order to demonstrate how the spatial distribution of shelters may
   influence population dynamics on both within and among population
   scales.
   In closed experimental streams, fish performance scaled negatively with
   decreasing shelter availability and increasing densities. In contrast,
   the fish in open stream channels dispersed according to shelter
   availability and performance of fish remaining in the streams did not
   depend on initial density or shelters.
   The field study confirmed that spatial variation in densities of
   1-year-old juveniles was governed both by initial recruit density and
   shelter availability. Strength of density-dependent population
   regulation, measured as carrying capacity, increased with decreasing
   number of shelters.
   Nine rivers were surveyed for spatial variation in shelter availability
   and increased shelter heterogeneity tended to decrease maximum observed
   population size (measured using catch statistics of adult salmon as a
   proxy).
   Our studies highlight the importance of small-scale within-population
   spatial structure in population dynamics and demonstrate that not only
   the absolute amount of limiting resources but also their spatial
   arrangement can be an important factor influencing population carrying
   capacity.},

Title = {Phylogeography of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Europe},

Abstract = {To investigate the phylogeographical patterns of red deer (Cervus
   elaphus) in Europe, and to disentangle the influence of ancient (e.g.
   Pleistocene ice ages) from more recent processes (e.g. human
   translocations).
   Europe.
   In this study we provide by far the most extensive analysis of genetic
   structure in European red deer, based on analyses of variation at two
   mitochondrial markers (cyt b and D-loop) in a large number of
   individuals from 39 locations. Relationships of mitochondrial DNA
   haplotypes were determined using minimum spanning networks and
   phylogenetic analyses. Population structure was examined by analyses of
   molecular variance. Historical processes shaping the present patterns
   were inferred from nested clade analysis and nucleotide diversity
   statistics.
   Within Europe, we detected three deeply divergent mitochondrial DNA
   lineages. The three lineages displayed a phylogeographical pattern
   dividing individuals into western European, eastern European and
   Mediterranean (Sardinia, Spain and Africa) groups, suggesting
   contraction into three separate refugia during the last glaciation. Few
   haplotypes were shared among these three groups, a finding also
   confirmed by F-ST values. Calculations of divergence times suggest that
   the groups probably split during the Pleistocene.
   The observed pattern is interpreted to result from isolation in
   different refugia during the last glaciation. The western and eastern
   European lineages could be linked to an Iberian and Balkan refugium,
   respectively. The third lineage might originate from a Sardinian or
   African refugium. We link local phylogeographical patterns observed in
   Europe to the post-glacial recolonization process, shaped by the
   geographical localization of refugia and barriers to gene flow.
   Regardless of the importance of red deer as a game species and the
   tradition of translocating red deer in Europe, we detected few
   individuals that did not match the trichotomous pattern, suggesting that
   translocations have occurred mainly at smaller spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Using thermal growth data from eight populations of anadromous and
   lake-feeding brown trout Salmo trutta, hypotheses of adaptation to local
   optima and countergradient variation in growth were tested. The
   adaptation to local optima hypothesis suggests that natural selection
   can shift optimal performance temperatures to match the prevailing
   temperature in a new or changed thermal niche. In contradiction, the
   countergradient variation hypothesis suggests that populations from
   hostile environments perform better than conspecifics from benign
   environments at all temperatures. In this study, growth capacity varied
   between populations but there was no significant correlation between any
   of the estimated thermal performance parameters (e.g. lower and upper
   thermal growth limits, optimal temperature for growth and maximum growth
   capacity) and natural climatic conditions among populations. Hence, S.
   trutta growth response to temperature lends no support for either of the
   two suggested thermal adaptation hypotheses. Instead, growth capacity
   among populations tended to correlate positively with female size at
   maturity.},

Abstract = {The long and narrow Hardanger fjord in western Norway has a high density
   of salmon farms and has had severe salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis,
   problems. In the years 2004-06, salmon lice numbers were recorded in
   selected salmon farms in the fjord as part of a larger research project.
   Most farm sites participated in a strategic control programme and were
   deloused between November and January in each year. The aim of the
   programme was to achieve a mean abundance of < 0.3 adult female lice at
   this time and to minimize the infection pressure on wild smolts in the
   spring. Dedicated teams carried out detailed counting of lice on farmed
   fish in April-September each year. Temperature conditions were fairly
   similar throughout the fjord and amongst years, but wide variations in
   salinities were observed. The two innermost zones, B and C, had the
   lowest lice mean abundances, whereas the outermost zones, D and E,
   consistently had more lice. General linear model analyses showed that
   differences in adult female lice abundance between the zones were
   associated with differing levels of salinity and emamectin benzoate
   treatments strategically administered. Mean fish weight was
   significantly positively correlated with mean abundance of adult female

Volume = {60},

Pages = {183-186},
Abstract = {Fish telemetry is increasingly used to study fish behaviour in marine
   systems and it is crucial that the tagging does not affect fish
   behaviour and welfare negatively. Hence, the long-term effects of
   surgically implanted acoustic telemetry transmitters on survival, tag
   retention, healing and growth on Pomatomus saltatrix (known as tailor in
   Australia, elf in South Africa and bluefish in North America) were
   studied over 144 days. P. saltatrix are well suited for transmitter
   implants because no tagging-related short- or long-term mortality or
   transmitter expulsion was recorded. Small transmitters (9 x 28 mm, 3.3 g
   in water) did not affect the specific growth rate of tagged fish
   compared with an untagged control group. In contrast, the fish tagged
   with large transmitters (13 x 50 mm, 6.9 g in water) had a reduced
   specific growth rate. The small, but not the large transmitter, seemed
   suitable for tagging P. saltatrix of the body sizes represented in this
   study (215-621 g). The specific growth rate was negatively affected by
   increasing the transmitter-mass-in-water to body-mass ratio. It is
   recommended that this ratio should not exceed 1.4\%.},

Title = {Climate change and phenological responses of two seabird species
   breeding in the high-Arctic},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {393},
Pages = {235-246},
Abstract = {The timing of breeding is a life-history trait that can greatly affect
   fitness, because successful reproduction depends on the match between
   the food requirements for raising young and the seasonal peak in food
   availability. We an alysed phenology (hatch dates) in relation to
   climate change for 2 seabird species breeding in the high-Arctic, little
   auks Alle alle and black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, for the
   periods 1963-2008 and 1970-2008, respectively. We show that spring
   climate has changed during the study period, with a strong increase in
   both air temperature (TEMP) and sea surface temperature (SST) and a
   decrease in sea ice concentration. Little auks showed a trend for
   earlier breeding over the study period, while kittimakes showed a
   non-significant trend for later breeding, demonstrating different
   phenological responses in these 2 species. Little auks and kittiwakes
   adjusted their timing of breeding to different environmental signals.
   Spring TEMP was the best predictor of little auk phenology, with a
   significant negative effect. Spring SST was the strongest predictor of
   kittiwake phenology, with a non-significant negative effect. Spring sea
   ice concentration and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index
   had a low relative variable importance. Furthermore, in kittiwakes,
   years with late breeding were associated with low clutch size and mean
   annual breeding success, indicating poor investment and food
   availability. This study identifies some spring environmental factors
   important for regulating the timing of breeding in the high-Arctic, most
   likely through effects on snow cover limiting access to nest sites and
   the development of the polar marine food web. It remains to be
   investigated whether environmental factors are reliable predictors of
   marine prey phenology, and whether the decision to start breeding is
   constrained by food availability.},

Title = {Migration and swimming depth of Atlantic salmon kelts Salmo salar in
   coastal zone and marine habitats},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {392},
Pages = {179-192},
Abstract = {Factors influencing the migration and swimming depth of Atlantic salmon
   kelts Salmo salar L. within the York Estuary and Gaspe Bay (Quebec,
   Canada), and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence between Gaspe Bay and the
   Strait of Belle Isle (Newfoundland, Canada) were studied using acoustic
   telemetry. In 2006 and 2007, a total of 49 kelts were tagged with
   acoustic transmitters equipped with depth sensors, released in the river
   delta leading into the estuary, and tracked using a fixed receiver array
   within the estuary and the bay. A large variation in migratory behavior
   existed, with some kelts making a direct, strongly oriented traverse
   across the estuary and bay, and others showing multiple changes in
   orientation. There was long-term residence (typically several weeks) in
   the river delta and rapid migration once kelts reached the estuary and
   bay resulting from seaward swimming, with a net seaward movement even on
   a flood tide. Diving was more frequent during daytime. It was
   hypothesized that diving may have been related to feeding and/or the
   identification of more temporally consistent sub-surface salinity
   gradients or current flow directions. The patterns of migration within
   the coastal zone were similar to those identified for smolts, implying a
   universal pattern of coastal zone migratory behavior in both smolts and
   kelts. Migration speed within the marine habitat was dependent on date
   of departure from Gaspe Bay, which in turn was dependent on the length
   of time kelts had remained in the delta. It was hypothesized that
   extended feeding within the delta allowed kelts to improve their
   physical condition, enabling them to migrate more rapidly in the marine
   habitat.},

Title = {Spatial interaction between seabirds and prey: review and synthesis},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {391},
Pages = {139-151},
Abstract = {The Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a close spatial match
   between predators and prey. Studies have shown that seabird and prey
   distribution seldom conforms with this prediction. In this study, I
   review recent theoretical advances in spatial predator-prey interactions
   and relate these with studies of seabirds and pelagic schooling fish and
   crustaceans. Studies on seabirds and prey have generally assumed that
   prey are nonresponsive. Predator-prey interactions should, however, be
   viewed as a 2-way spatial game where seabirds track concentrations of
   prey while prey move away from areas with high risk of predation. The
   outcome of the game depends on how seabirds and prey are spatially
   constrained. Constraints include the spatial distribution of resources,
   interspecific competition, the location of spawning and breeding areas,
   and limitations on diving depth. Although game theoretic models can
   explain some general aspects of the spatial interaction, the spatial
   distribution of seabirds and prey is generally much more aggregated and
   elusive than can be expected from the game theoretic equilibrium. This
   is because spatial pattern is formed through self-organizing behavior
   that includes schooling, local enhancement and area-restricted search
   (ARS). Schooling and local enhancement are processes with strong
   positive density dependence that destabilize the predator-prey
   interaction locally. However, the unstable local dynamics might be
   stabilized by spatial constraints and the effects of ARS processes at
   large scales.},

Title = {Coastal salmon farms attract large and persistent aggregations of wild
   fish: an ecosystem effect},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {385},
Pages = {1-14},
Abstract = {Coastal aquaculture is a globally expanding enterprise. Currently, 1200
   salmon farms operate in coastal Norway, yet their capacity to aggregate
   and subsequently modify wild fish distributions is poorly known.
   Aggregations of wild fish at 9 farms and 9 control locations were
   counted on 3 separate days in June to August 2007. On each sampling
   occasion, 6 counts were made at 5 distinct depth-strata at each farm and
   control location. Wild fish were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude more
   abundant at farms than at control sites, depending on the location.
   Gadoid fish (Pollachius virens, Gadus morhua and Melanogrammus
   aeglefinus) dominated farm-associated assemblages and were present
   across a wide range of sizes, from juveniles to large adults. Estimated
   total farm-aggregated wild fish biomass averaged 10.2 metric tonnes (t)
   per farm across the 9 farms (range: 600 kg to 41.6 t). Applied across
   the geographical range of Norway's 1200 salmon farms, our estimates
   indicate that salmon farms attract and aggregate over 12 000 t of wild
   fish into a total of just 750 ha of coastal waters on any given clay in
   summer. Possible consequences of these persistent, substantial
   aggregations of wild fishes at farms include a heightened potential for
   the transfer of pathogens from salmon farms to wild fish and among
   adjacent salmon farms, and altered availability of wild fish to
   fisheries. Restrictions on fishing in the immediate surrounds of salmon
   farms may avoid farms acting as ecological traps, particularly for
   species with depressed populations such as G. morhua, which are highly
   attracted to farms.},

Title = {Climatic change as an engine for speciation in flightless Orthoptera

Abstract = {Many East African mountains are characterized by an exceptionally high
   biodiversity. Here we assess the hypothesis that climatic fluctuations
   during the Plio-Pleistocene led to ecological fragmentation with
   subsequent genetic isolation and speciation in forest habitats in East
   Africa. Hypotheses on speciation in savannah lineages are also
   investigated. To do this, mitochondrial DNA sequences from a group of
   bush crickets consisting of both forest and savannah inhabiting taxa
   were analysed in relation to Plio-Pleistocene range fragmentations
   indicated by palaeoclimatic studies. Coalescent modelling and mismatch
   distributions were used to distinguish between alternative
   biogeographical scenarios. The results indicate two radiations: the
   earliest one overlaps in time with the global spread of C4 grasslands
   and only grassland inhabiting lineages originated in this radiation.
   Climatically induced retraction of forest to higher altitudes about 0.8
   million years ago, promoting vicariant speciation in species inhabiting
   the montane zone, can explain the second radiation. Although much of the
   biodiversity in East Africa is presently threatened by climate change,
   past climatic fluctuations appear to have contributed to the species
   richness observed in the East African hot spots. Perceiving forests as
   centres of speciation reinforces the importance of conserving the
   remaining forest patches in the region.},

Title = {New perspectives in diet analysis based on DNA barcoding and parallel

Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-60},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The development of DNA barcoding (species identification using a
   standardized DNA sequence), and the availability of recent DNA
   sequencing techniques offer new possibilities in diet analysis. DNA
   fragments shorter than 100-150 bp remain in a much higher proportion in
   degraded DNA samples and can be recovered from faeces. As a consequence,
   by using universal primers that amplify a very short but informative DNA
   fragment, it is possible to reliably identify the plant taxon that has
   been eaten. According to our experience and using this identification
   system, about 50\% of the taxa can be identified to species using the
   trnL approach, that is, using the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL (UAA)
   intron. We demonstrated that this new method is fast, simple to
   implement, and very robust. It can be applied for diet analyses of a
   wide range of phytophagous species at large scales. We also demonstrated
   that our approach is efficient for mammals, birds, insects and molluscs.
   This method opens new perspectives in ecology, not only by allowing
   large-scale studies on diet, but also by enhancing studies on resource
   partitioning among competing species, and describing food webs in
   ecosystems.},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {63},

Pages = {225-232},
Abstract = {There is a major trend in forest management that local managers are
   being replaced by entrepreneurs, who are often less place-dependent.
   Entrepreneurs are also more updated when it comes to scientific
   knowledge and national and international trends in forest values and
   functions, as well as knowledge about general planning and management
   concepts that have high value for tourism and recreation. Parallel with
   the observed changing management culture, there also seems to be an
   increased abstraction of forest values and functions in forest
   certification programmes. The article briefly presents some key aspects
   of Aldo Leopold's thinking that are of relevance for forest stewardship,
   and discusses these in relation to main forest stewardship trends in a
   Nordic forestry context. In a Nordic tradition, forest management and
   planning are deeply rooted in local management practice carried out by
   official local supervisors in cooperation with forest owners and other
   stakeholders. Local traditions and accumulated local knowledge over time
   were, in addition to updated scientific knowledge, important skills for
   local managers. Today's post-modern forestry includes complex
   multi-valued forest situations on different scales, which are even more
   complex and challenging to manage than the more utilitarian historical
   forest was.},

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {403-416},
Abstract = {This study evaluates how the placement and the different possible
   outcomes of a spruce retention tree affected species richness and
   assemblages of spruce-associated saproxylic beetles. In a field
   experiment in the boreal zone of central Norway, high stumps were
   created and compared with residual wood pieces (i.e. top boles with
   branches), in clear-cuts versus in forest edges. Flight interception
   traps were mounted close to the substrate. The results were analysed
   using rarefaction techniques, ordination (DCA) and ANOVA. It was found
   that the placement of retention trees of spruce does matter: beetle
   assemblages were significantly different in stumps in the four
   treatments. For all species pooled, the species richness was higher in
   stumps in clear-cuts than in stumps or boles in the forest edge. Four
   red-listed species were more abundant near stumps than boles, and two
   red-listed species were more abundant in clear-cuts than forest edge. To
   cater for the variety of habitat preferences among forest beetles in
   managed forest, managers should leave both standing spruce trees (many
   of which will end up as windthrown, downed holes) and some high stumps
   (to secure some upright dead wood), in both exposed clear-cut and
   semi-shaded forest edge.},

Volume = {20},

Pages = {85-93},
Abstract = {We asked whether den site characteristics of Scandinavian brown bears
   (Ursus arctos) were related to bear sex or age by analyzing the nearest
   distances to human structures within 10 km, the forest composition
   within 50 m, and topography within 5 m of 391 winter dens used by 114
   individuals during 1986-2003 in south-central Sweden. Subadult males and
   subadult females used more pine (Pinus sylvestris) than spruce (Picea
   abies) denning habitats than did adult males. Adult males selected nest
   dens over rock dens more strongly than did subadult males, and they
   selected nest dens over anthill, soil, and rock dens more strongly than
   did subadult females, pregnant females, or females with cubs. Topography
   differed among den types but showed a poor relationship with different
   age-sex classes of bears. Abandoned dens were located closer to plowed
   roads than dens used successfully all winter. Adult males denned farther
   from permanently occupied houses and plowed roads than did other
   categories of bears, perhaps because they were least tolerant of human
   disturbance. In general, den sites of adult males differed the most from
   other age-sex classes of bears.},

Abstract = {We propose a new cover cylinder as a useful tool for a single observer
   to measure horizontal cover in the field. We compared it with 4 other
   methods for measuring horizontal cover at brown bear (Ursus arctos)
   beds, with all measurements taken 10 m from beds in the 4 cardinal
   directions. We also compared cylinder cover values from a fixed distance
   with an index of cover, namely a sighting distance, D, the minimum
   distance at which the cylinder could no longer be seen; we also compared
   measurements from a random direction and from the 4 cardinal directions.
   The cylinder provided measurements comparable to other devices,
   including a cardboard profile of a bedded bear, and was the most
   practical to use in the field. Measuring D was scarcely more time
   consuming than measuring cover from the fixed 10-m distance, and D is
   better for statistical analysis. We recommend the cylinder, and using
   the index of cover, D, taken from the 4 cardinal directions, when
   assessing horizontal cover for bears or other medium and large
   terrestrial vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Cultured fish escaping from farms represent an economic loss as well as
   a potential problem for wild fish populations. This study investigated
   the escape-related behaviour of farmed Norwegian coastal and northeast
   Arctic cod (NEAC), Gadus morhua L. Six groups of fish were observed
   during three replicate trials in a large tank that was split into two
   equal parts by a net wall. The fish could move freely through an opening
   in the net during the trials. Three groups were not fed during the
   trials. The first escape occurred shortly after producing the net
   opening (11 +/- 10.5 min; mean +/- standard deviation). Norwegian
   coastal cod were more prone to escape than the NEAC. A starvation period
   of 9 days increased the number of fish on the escape side of the tank.
   Net biting and net inspection by the fish were frequently observed,
   irrespective of whether the fish were fed or not. The same fish were
   repeatedly found on the escape side of the tank, but the propensity for
   recurrent escape behaviour was not related to genotype, feeding status
   or size. The results suggest that other factors, such as individual
   variation in boldness or exploration behaviour, could affect the
   willingness to escape.},

Abstract = {We measured the responses of ungulate grazers to roads by recording the
   density of dust on grasses and compared distance sampling of ungulates
   in Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania. Data were collected on the
   east and west side of the Ngorongoro-Seronera main gravel road to test
   if road traffic and dust were important factors determining distribution
   patterns amongst grazers. Results indicate that dust increased
   progressively with traffic speed and volume during dry season. More dust
   was intercepted on the west than on the east side of the road mainly
   because of wind effects. Dust deposition (measured as density g grass
   g(-1) dust) was higher on short grasses than on long grasses during the
   dry and late-dry seasons than during the wet season, when paired
   perpendicular distances up to 300 m were compared. Mean number of
   observed grazer species indicated that most fed further from the west
   side of the road than from the east perhaps to minimize higher density
   of dust commonly spread on foliage up to 200 m away from the road.
   Despite that most grazers avoided road side grass shoulders, supporting
   the `dust aversion hypothesis', the test predictions from the `road
   disturbance' and the `road attraction' hypotheses did not support the
   responsive behaviours of grazers toward roads.},

Title = {Phenotype-Specific Bacterial Communities in the Cold-Water Coral
   Lophelia pertusa (Scleractinia) and Their Implications for the Coral's
   Nutrition, Health, and Distribution},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},

Abstract = {The pseudocolonial coral Lophelia pertusa (Scleractinia,
   Caryophylliidae) is a eurybathic, stenothermal cosmopolitan cold-water
   species. It occurs in two color varieties, white and red. L. pertusa
   builds vast cold-water coral reefs along the continental margins, which
   are among the most diverse deep-sea habitats. Microbiology of L. pertusa
   has been in scientific focus for only a few years, but the question of
   whether the coral holds a host-specific bacterial community has not been
   finally answered. Bacteria on coral samples from the Trondheimsfjord
   (Norway) were characterized by the culture-independent 16S rRNA
   gene-based techniques terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
   and sequence analysis. L. pertusa revealed a high microbial richness.
   Clone sequences were dominated by members of the Alpha- and
   Gammaproteobacteria. Other abundant taxa were Bacteroidetes,
   Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes. The
   bacterial community of L. pertusa not only differed conspicuously from
   that of the environment but also varied with both the location and color
   variety of its host. Therefore, the microbial colonization cannot be
   termed ``specific{''} sensu stricto. However, similarities to other
   coral-bacterium associations suggest the existence of ``cold-water
   coral-specific{''} bacterial groups sensu lato. L. pertusa-associated
   bacteria appear to play a significant role in the nutrition of their
   host by degradation of sulfur compounds, cellulose, chitin, and end
   products of the coral's anaerobic metabolism. Some coral-associated
   microbes were regarded as opportunistic pathogens. Dominance of
   mixotrophic members of the Rhodobacteraceae in white L. pertusa could
   explain the wider dispersal of this phenotype by supplementary
   nutrition.},

Title = {A review and a framework for the integration of biodiversity monitoring

Volume = {17},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The monitoring of biodiversity at the level of habitats is becoming
   widespread in Europe and elsewhere as countries establish national
   habitat monitoring systems and various organisations initiate regional
   and local schemes. Parallel to this growth, it is increasingly important
   to address biodiversity changes on large spatial (e.g. continental) and
   temporal (e.g. decade-long) scales, which requires the integration of
   currently ongoing monitoring efforts. Here we review habitat monitoring
   and develop a framework for integrating data or activities across
   habitat monitoring schemes. We first identify three basic properties of
   monitoring activities: spatial aspect (explicitly spatial vs.
   non-spatial), documentation of spatial variation (field mapping vs.
   remote sensing) and coverage of habitats (all habitats or specific
   habitats in an area), and six classes of monitoring schemes based on
   these properties. Then we explore tasks essential for integrating
   schemes both within and across the major classes. Finally, we evaluate
   the need and potential for integration of currently existing schemes by
   drawing on data collected on European habitat monitoring in the EuMon
   project. Our results suggest a dire need for integration if we are to
   measure biodiversity changes across large spatial and temporal scales
   regarding the 2010 target and beyond. We also make recommendations for
   an integrated pan-European habitat monitoring scheme. Such a scheme
   should be based on remote sensing to record changes in land cover and
   habitat types over large scales, with complementary field mapping using
   unified methodology to provide ground truthing and to monitor
   small-scale changes, at least in habitat types of conservation
   importance.},

Abstract = {Four species of otters (Mustelidae, Lutrinae) occur in Southeast Asia
   and are considered to be of conservation concern: Aonyx cinerea (Asian
   small-clawed otter), Lutra lutra (Eurasian otter), Lutra sumatrana
   (Hairy-nosed otter), and Lutrogale perspicillata (Smooth-coated otter).
   Among these, L. sumatrana is endemic to the region, yet little is known
   about its biology, and the precise distribution of all four species in
   Southeast Asia is not well known. Furthermore, the taxonomy and
   systematics of L. sumatrana and L. perspicillata have been the subject
   of controversy, which has implications for the legal protection and for
   conservation programs of these taxa. To resolve these controversies, we
   used a multigene data set comprised of segments from 13 nuclear and 5
   mitochondrial loci (11,180 nucleotides) to evaluate the phylogenetic
   relationships of Asian Old World otters. Phylogenies were also estimated
   using two mitochondrial loci (1,832 nucleotides) obtained from two or
   more individuals of the four Southeast Asian species. The results from
   maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference showed that
   L. sumatrana and L. lutra are sister taxa, whereas L. perspicillata is
   sister to A. cinerea. Furthermore, the results from the
   two-mitochondrial gene analyses indicate that L. sumatrana is
   reciprocally monophyletic with respect to L. lutra, supporting the
   specific validity of the former taxon. Signs such as tracks and feces
   are often used in field surveys to provide information on the
   distribution and abundance of otters, but the accuracy of these methods
   may be compromised when several closely related species occur
   sympatrically. Therefore, the two-gene data set was used to develop a
   provisional set of diagnostic nucleotides that can be potentially used
   to identify the four species of Southeast Asian otters from
   noninvasively collected biological samples, such as feces.},

Abstract = {In mammals, reproductive synchrony and reproductive suppression usually
   are found in social, group-living species, which often display
   hierarchical relationships among related animals. Some individuals,
   particularly younger, philopatric females beyond the age of sexual
   maturity, may not raise offspring because they are suppressed by other
   individuals. Although brown bears (Ursus arctos) are a solitary species,
   the existence of socially induced delayed primiparity of philopatric
   females has been documented. Here we show further evidence for
   interactions of a population-regulatory nature that are typically
   associated with social species. We found that an adult female's
   probability of having cubs in a given year was influenced by whether or
   not her nearest neighboring adult female had cubs. At short distances
   (<= 10 km) between the home range centroids of neighboring females,
   females with cubs had a negative effect on their neighboring female's
   probability of having cubs of the year. At distances >10 km and <= 20
   km, the effect reversed, and it disappeared beyond 20 km. We argue that
   reproductive suppression is probably caused by resource competition
   among females living close to each other. Previously, similar population
   regulation mechanisms have been found only in group-living mammals.
   Thus, social interactions and behavior in solitary carnivores may be
   more flexible than usually assumed.},

Title = {Detailed analysis of polybrominated biphenyl congeners in bird eggs from
   Norway},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Volume = {156},

Abstract = {Individual eggs of six species of birds from Norway representing
   different food chains were analysed for residues of polybrominated
   biphenyls (PBBs). In all species, the residue pattern was dominated by
   hexaBBs. The dominating congeners were PBB 153, PBB 154, and IPBB 155.
   Whereas PBB 153 is present in technical hexabromobiphenyl, PBB 154 and
   PBB 155 are formed by the reductive debromination of decabromobiphenyl.
   This was evidenced by the detection of several heptaBBs and octaBBs all
   of which are typical degradation intermediates of PBB 209. Hepta- and
   octaBBs were more than one order of magnitude less abundant than the
   hexaBBs. The second most prevailing homologue group was pentaBBs. The
   most relevant pentabrominated isomers were PBB 99 and PBB 101.
   Concentrations of the three hexaBBs - PBB 153, PBB 154, and PBB 155 -
   amounted to 1.3-13 ng/g wet weight or 3-23\% of the contamination with
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Recruitment variability of resident brown trout in peripheral
   populations from southern Europe},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {53},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2364-2374},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Population regulation was studied for seven consecutive years
   (1992-98) in five rivers at the periphery of the distribution of Salmo
   trutta, where the fish were living under environmental constraints quite
   different from those of the main distribution area.
   2. Recruitment is naturally highly variable and the populations had been
   earlier classified as overexploited. Thus we expected that densities of
   young trout in most populations would be too low for density-dependent
   mortality to operate. We tested this by fitting the abundance of
   recruits to egg densities over seven consecutive years
   (stock-recruitment relationship), and used the results to judge whether
   exploitation should be restricted in the interests of conserving the
   populations.
   3. The density of 0+ trout in early September, as well as the initial
   density of eggs and parents, varied greatly among localities and years.
   The data for all populations fitted the Ricker stock-recruitment model.
   The proportion of variance explained by the population curves varied
   between 32\% and 51\%. However, in most cases the observations were in
   the density-independent part of the stock-recruitment curve, where
   densities of the recruits increased proportionally with egg densities.
   4. Our findings suggest that recruitment densities in most rivers and
   years were below the carrying capacity of the habitats. Although
   density-dependent mechanisms seemed to regulate fish abundance in some
   cases, environmental factors and harvesting appeared generally to
   preclude populations from reaching densities high enough for negative
   feedbacks to operate. The findings thus lend support to Haldane's (1956)
   second hypothesis that changes in population density are primarily due
   to density-independent factors in unfavourable areas and areas with low
   density due to exploitation. Exploitation should be reduced to allow
   natural selection to operate more effectively.},

Title = {Modelling and predicting fungal distribution patterns using herbarium
   data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2298-2310},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The main aims of this study are: (1) to test if temperature and related
   parameters are the primary determinants of the regional distribution of
   macrofungi (as is commonly recognized for plants); (2) to test if the
   success of modelling fungal distribution patterns depends on species and
   distribution characteristics; and (3) to explore the potential of using
   herbarium data for modelling and predicting fungal species'
   distributions.
   The study area, Norway, spans 58-71 degrees N latitude and 4-32 degrees
   E longitude, and embraces extensive ecological gradients in a small
   area.
   The study is based on 1020 herbarium collections of nine selected
   species of macrofungi and a set of 75 environmental predictor variables,
   all recorded in a 5 x 5-km grid covering Norway. Primarily, generalized
   linear model (GLM; logistic regression) analyses were used to identify
   the environmental variables that best accounted for the species'
   recorded distributions in Norway. Second, Maxent analyses (using
   variables identified by GLM) were used to produce predictive potential
   distribution maps for these species.
   Variables relating to temperature and radiation were most frequently
   included in the GLMs, and between 24.8\% and 59.8\% of the variation in
   single-species occurrence was accounted for. The fraction of variation
   explained by the GLMs ranged from 41.6\% to 59.8\% for species with
   restricted distributions, and from 24.8\% to 39.3\% for species with
   widespread/scattered and intermediate distributions. The two-step
   procedure of GLM followed by Maxent gave predictions with very high
   values for the area under the curve (0.927-0.997), and maps of potential
   distribution were generally credible.
   We show that temperature is a key factor governing the distribution of
   macrofungi in Norway, indicating that fungi may respond strongly to
   global warming. We confirm that modelling success depends partly on
   species and distribution characteristics, notably on how the
   distribution relates to the extent of the study area. Our study
   demonstrates that the combination of GLM and Maxent may be a fruitful
   approach for biogeography. We conclude that herbarium data improve
   insight into factors that control the distributions of fungi, of
   particular value for research on fleshy fungi (mushrooms), which have
   largely cryptic life cycles.},

Abstract = {The effects of growth hormone (GH) implants on aggression, and ability
   to win dyadic territorial conflicts were studied in brown trout Salmo
   trutta parr. Bovine GH or vehicle (C) was given to either the territory
   owner or the intruder in four treatment combinations: C and C, C and GH,
   GH and C, GH and GH (owner and intruder). GH-treated intruders initiated
   significantly more conflicts compared to control intruders. Furthermore,
   GH treatment of either the owner or intruder tended to increase
   aggression of the intruder. This indicates that intruders have more
   scope for motivational increase, while the motivation of owners is
   already at a maximum. The GH treatment, however, did not affect the
   outcome of the conflict. It thus appears that growth enhancement
   increases intruder aggression without increasing the chance of winning
   the conflict, which may have implications for the effect of
   growth-selected or growth-enhanced farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar on
   wild populations.},

Title = {Lack of compensatory body growth in a high performance moose Alces alces
   population},

Abstract = {Considerable work has been done on disentangling important factors
   determining early development in body size, yet our knowledge of the
   extent to which animals living under varying conditions can achieve
   catch-up growth for a bad start in life is limited. Here, we
   investigated how body mass at the age of 8 months influenced adult body
   mass in a moose Alces alces population living under excellent
   environmental conditions on the island of Vega in northern Norway. We
   also investigated if mother age and birth date effects on calf body mass
   persisted until adulthood. We show that neither males nor females were
   able to show compensatory growth before they reached adulthood, and that
   part of the variation in adult body mass may have been due to variation
   in mother age and date of birth. The pattern observed in males can be
   related to their growth strategy in relation to reproduction, while such
   results were not expected in females where size-dependent start of
   reproduction is likely to interact with body growth. We suggest that the
   good environmental conditions experienced on Vega led to females having
   small somatic costs of an early start of reproduction or that larger
   females were able to acquire more resources for growth than their
   smaller conspecifics. In both cases, females that postpone their first
   reproduction may not be able to achieve catch-up growth for their lower
   early body mass compared to females that start reproduction at an early
   age. Our results concur with previous studies indicating that
   compensatory growth is weak in moose, increasing the likelihood that
   variation in life history characters are also transferred between
   generations.},

Title = {Linking climate change to lemming cycles},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {456},

Pages = {93-U3},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {The population cycles of rodents at northern latitudes have puzzled
   people for centuries(1,2), and their impact is manifest throughout the
   alpine ecosystem(2,3). Climate change is known to be able to drive
   animal population dynamics between stable and cyclic phases(4,5), and
   has been suggested to cause the recent changes in cyclic dynamics of
   rodents and their predators(3,6-9). But although predator - rodent
   interactions are commonly argued to be the cause of the Fennoscandian
   rodent cycles(1,10-13), the role of the environment in the modulation of
   such dynamics is often poorly understood in natural systems(8,9,14).
   Hence, quantitative links between climate-driven processes and rodent
   dynamics have so far been lacking. Here we show that winter weather and
   snow conditions, together with density dependence in the net population
   growth rate, account for the observed population dynamics of the rodent
   community dominated by lemmings ( Lemmus lemmus) in an alpine Norwegian
   core habitat between 1970 and 1997, and predict the observed absence of
   rodent peak years after 1994. These local rodent dynamics are coherent
   with alpine bird dynamics both locally and over all of southern Norway,
   consistent with the influence of large- scale fluctuations in winter
   conditions. The relationship between commonly available meteorological
   data and snow conditions indicates that changes in temperature and
   humidity, and thus conditions in the subnivean space, seem to markedly
   affect the dynamics of alpine rodents and their linked groups. The
   pattern of less regular rodent peaks, and corresponding changes in the
   overall dynamics of the alpine ecosystem, thus seems likely to prevail
   over a growing area under projected climate change.},

Abstract = {Despite global occurrence of several perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) the
   potential ecological effects off such substances on natural populations
   are not known. In endangered lesser black-backed gulls (Laurs fuscus
   fuscus) on the Norwegian Coast, the blood concentrations of PFCs were as
   high as legacy organochlorines (OCs), and here we examined whether PFCs
   show associations similar to those of OCs to factors potentially
   affecting population growth, by evaluating relationships between
   contaminant concentrations and demographic parameters (reproductive
   performance and probability of adults returning between breeding
   seasons), PFCs were not adversely associated with demographic
   parameters, while the most persistent OCs: notably PCB and p,p'-DDE,
   were adversely associated with early chick survival, and adult return
   rate. This study thus suggests that when the concentrations of PFCs and
   OCs are of similar magnitude in a gull population. OCs are more likely
   to cause adverse ecological effects. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Impacts of extreme winter warming in the sub-Arctic: growing season
   responses of dwarf shrub heathland},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2603-2612},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change scenarios predict an increased frequency of extreme
   climatic events. In Arctic regions, one of the most profound of these
   are extreme and sudden winter warming events in which temperatures
   increase rapidly to above freezing, often causing snow melt across whole
   landscapes and exposure of ecosystems to warm temperatures. Following
   warming, vegetation and soils no longer insulated below snow are then
   exposed to rapidly returning extreme cold. Using a new experimental
   facility established in sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland in northern
   Sweden, we simulated an extreme winter warming event in the field and
   report findings on growth, phenology and reproduction during the
   subsequent growing season. A 1-week long extreme winter warming event
   was simulated in early March using infrared heating lamps run with or
   without soil warming cables. Both single short events delayed bud
   development of Vaccinium myrtillus by up to 3 weeks in the following
   spring (June) and reduced flower production by more than 80\%: this also
   led to a near-complete elimination of berry production in mid-summer.
   Empetrum hermaphroditum also showed delayed bud development. In
   contrast, Vaccinium vitis-idaea showed no delay in bud development, but
   instead appeared to produce a greater number of actively growing
   vegetative buds within plots warmed by heating lamps only. Again, there
   was evidence of reduced flowering and berry production in this species.
   While bud break was delayed, growing season measurements of growth and
   photosynthesis did not reveal a differential response in the warmed
   plants for any of the species. These results demonstrate that a single,
   short, extreme winter warming event can have considerable impact on bud
   production, phenology and reproductive effort of dominant plant species
   within sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland. Furthermore, large
   interspecific differences in sensitivity are seen. These findings are of
   considerable concern, because they suggest that repeated events may
   potentially impact on the biodiversity and productivity of these systems
   should these extreme events increase in frequency as a result of global
   change. Although climate change may lengthen the growing season by
   earlier spring snow melt, there is a profound danger for these
   high-latitude ecosystems if extreme, short-lived warming in winter
   exposes plants to initial warm temperatures, but then extreme cold for
   the rest of the winter. Work is ongoing to determine the longer term and
   wider impacts of these events.},

Title = {Diet shift of a facultative scavenger, the wolverine, following
   recolonization of wolves},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {77},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1183-1190},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. Wolves Canis lupus L. recolonized the boreal forests in the southern
   part of the Scandinavian peninsula during the late 1990s, but so far
   there has been little attention to its effect on ecosystem functioning.
   Wolf predation increases the availability of carcasses of large prey,
   especially moose Alces alces L., which may lead in turn to a diet switch
   in facultative scavengers such as the wolverine Gulo gulo L.
   2. Using 459 wolverine scats collected during winter-spring 2001-04 for
   DNA identity and dietary contents, we compared diet inside and outside
   wolf territories while controlling for potential confounding factors,
   such as prey density. We tested the hypothesis that wolverine diet
   shifted towards moose in the presence of wolves, while taking into
   account possible sexual segregation between the sexes. Occurrence of
   reindeer, moose and small prey was modelled against explanatory
   covariates using logistic mixed-effects models. Furthermore, we compared
   diet composition and breadth among habitats and sexes.
   3. Occurrence of reindeer, moose and small prey in the diet varied with
   prey availability and habitat. As expected, diet contained more moose
   and less reindeer and small prey in the presence of wolves. Their diet
   in tundra consisted of 40\% reindeer Rangifer tarandus L., 39\% moose
   and 9\% rodents. In forest with wolf, their diet shifted to 76\% moose,
   18\% reindeer and 5\% rodents; compared to 42\% moose, 32\% reindeer and
   15\% rodents in forest without wolf. This diet switch could not be
   explained by higher moose density in wolf territories. Female diet
   consisted of more small prey than for males, but there was a tendency
   for females to use the highly available moose carrion opportunistically
   and to hunt less on small prey within wolf territories.
   4. Our study highlights how wolves increase scavenging opportunities for
   wolverines, and how sexual differences in diet may also apply to large
   scavengers. Due to their more restricted home range, female wolverines
   are forced to rely more on hunting small prey. The relatively high
   occurrence of wolf kills, however, forms an important food source to
   wolverines in this area. The recolonization of wolves may therefore have
   contributed to the consequent recolonization of wolverines into the same
   area.},

Title = {The onset of spring and timing of migration in two arctic nesting goose
   populations: the pink-footed goose Anser bachyrhynchus and the barnacle

Abstract = {An earlier onset of spring has been recorded for many parts of Eurasia
   in recent decades. This has consequences for migratory species, both in
   changing the conditions encountered by individuals on reaching migratory
   sites and in affecting cues regulating the timing of migration where
   decisions to migrate are influenced by local environmental variables.
   Here we examine the timing of spring migration for two arctic goose
   populations, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus (during
   1990-2003) and barnacle goose Branta leucopsis (during 1982-2003), which
   both breed on Svalbard. The satellite-derived Normalised Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to express the onset of spring at their
   wintering and spring staging sites. Pink-footed geese use several sites
   during spring migration, ranging from the southernmost wintering areas
   in Belgium to two spring staging areas in Norway, and distances between
   sites used along the flyway are relatively short. There was a positive
   correlation in the onset of spring between neighbouring sites, and the
   geese migrated earlier in early springs. Barnacle geese, on the other
   hand, have a long overseas crossing from their wintering grounds in
   Britain to spring staging areas in Norway. Although spring advanced in
   both regions, there was no corresponding correlation in the timing of
   onset of spring between their wintering and spring staging sites, and
   little evidence for barnacle geese migrating earlier over the whole
   study period. Hence, where geese can use spring conditions at one site
   as an indicator of the conditions they might encounter at the next, they
   have responded quickly to the advancement of spring, whereas in a
   situation where they cannot predict, they have not yet responded,
   despite the advancement of spring in the spring staging area.},

Title = {The LEDA Traitbase: a database of life-history traits of the Northwest
   European flora},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. An international group of scientists has built an open internet data
   base of life-history traits of the Northwest European flora (the
   LEDA-Traitbase) that can be used as a data source for fundamental
   research on plant biodiversity and coexistence, macro-ecological
   patterns and plant functional responses.
   2. The species-trait matrix comprises referenced information under the
   control of an editorial board, for ca. 3000 species of the Northwest
   European flora, combining existing information and additional
   measurements. The data base currently contains data on 26 plant traits
   that describe three key features of plant dynamics: persistence,
   regeneration and dispersal. The LEDA-Traitbase is freely available at
   www.leda-traitbase.org.
   3. We present the structure of the data base and an overview of the
   trait information available.
   4. Synthesis. The LEDA Traitbase is useful for large-scale analyses of
   functional responses of communities to environmental change, effects of
   community trait composition on ecosystem properties and patterns of
   rarity and invasiveness, as well as linkages between traits as
   expressions of fundamental trade-offs in plants.},

Title = {Factors affecting the within-river spawning migration of Atlantic
   salmon, with emphasis on human impacts},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {345-371},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We review factors affecting the within-river spawning migration of
   Atlantic salmon. With populations declining across the entire
   distribution range, it is important that spawners survive in the last
   phase of the spawning migration. Knowledge on the factors affecting
   migration is essential for the protection of populations, and to
   increase the success of reintroduction programmes. A number of studies
   have documented that the upstream migration may be delayed for many
   weeks at man-made obstacles such as power station outlets, residual flow
   stretches, dams, weirs and fishways. The fish may also be delayed at
   natural migration barriers. Often, the magnitude of delay is not
   predictable; fish may be considerably delayed at barriers that appear to
   humans to be easily passable, or they may quickly pass barriers that
   appear difficult. Stressful events like catch-and-release angling may
   affect upstream migration. Impacts of human activities may also cause
   altered migration patterns, affect the within-river distribution of the
   spawning population, and severe barriers may result in displacement of
   the spawning population to other rivers. Factors documented to affect
   within-river migration include previous experience, water discharge,
   water temperature, water velocity, required jump heights, fish size,
   fish acclimatisation, light, water quality/pollution, time of the
   season, and catch and handling stress. How each of these factors affects
   the upstream migration is to a varying extent understood; however, the
   effects may differ among different river sections and sites. There are
   likely a number of additional important factors, and the relationship
   between different factors is complex. The understanding of general
   mechanisms stimulating fish within-river migration are still lacking,
   and it cannot be reliably predicted under which conditions a fish will
   pass a given migration barrier or which conditions are needed to
   stimulate migration at different sites. The strong focus on the effects
   of water discharge in past work may have hampered consideration of other
   factors. Exploration of the influence of these other factors in future
   studies could improve our understanding of what controls the upstream
   migration.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {4},
Number = {5},
Pages = {538-540},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Habitat selection and dispersal behaviour are key processes in
   evolutionary ecology. Recent studies have suggested that individuals may
   use the reproductive performance of conspecifics as a source of public
   information on breeding patch quality for dispersal decisions, but
   experimental evidence is still limited for species breeding in
   aggregates, i.e. colonial species. We addressed this issue by
   manipulating the local breeding success of marked individuals and that
   of their neighbours on a series of breeding patches of a colonial
   seabird, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). Based on
   previous observations in this species, we predicted that individuals
   that lost their eggs on successful patches would attend their nest and
   come back to it the year after at a higher rate than individuals that
   lost their eggs on patches where their neighbours were also in failure.
   As predicted, the attendance of breeders and prospectors was strongly
   affected by the local level of breeding success, resulting in
   differential site fidelity and recruitment. This suggests that
   individuals used information conveyed by conspecific breeding
   performance to make decisions relative to breeding site selection. This
   process can amplify the response of these populations to environmental
   change and may have contributed to the evolution of colonial breeding.},

Abstract = {The emigration patterns among radio-tagged trout, Salmo trutta L., kelts

   (BL): 22-30 cm] in the regulated River Gudbrandsdalslagen, south-east
   Norway, were studied by investigating the influence of sex (kelts) and
   BL (kelts and smolts) on the timing of emigration. In total, 49\% of the
   kelts emigrated towards the hydroelectric dam shortly after spawning,
   whilst 51\% over-wintered. Female kelts were five times more likely to
   initiate autumn emigration, and eight times more likely to descend the
   spillways during the first release of surface water than males. Large
   individuals of both sexes descended earlier than smaller individuals.
   Larger smolts were more likely to descend during the first release of

Abstract = {The seaward migration of European silver eel Anguilla anguilla (L.) was
   studied during the late freshwater and early marine phase in River
   Gudenaa and Randers Fjord, Denmark, in the spring 2004. Migration was
   monitored in sections with different physical characteristics over a
   total distance of 46 km using automatic listening stations. Generally,
   eels quickly left the River Gudenaa (67\% within 2 days) and stayed for
   up to 4.3 months (mean 1.7 months) in the inner fjord. This indicates a
   two-step migration, with silver eels migrating out of the river in the
   spring, followed by a substantial residence period in the inner part of
   the fjord before continuing the migration. The results suggest that
   silver eel migration may not always be a direct journey to the ocean,
   but may include resident periods in coastal areas. The eels were
   subjected to a high mortality with less then 20\% surviving out of the
   fjord. Fishing seemed to be the main reason for the mortality.},

Abstract = {The home range and area use of spotted grunter, Pomadasys commersonnii

   two periods in 2003. Tagged fish spent on average 68 and 77\% of the
   time in the estuary and the remaining time at sea during the two
   periods, respectively. While in the estuary, there was large variation
   in home range size, home range length and the number of home range areas
   amongst individuals. Larger fish had larger home ranges and more core
   areas than smaller fish. The home ranges of 29 individuals (74\%)
   occurred in the lower reaches of the estuary, suggesting that the

Title = {The rarity concept and the commonness of rarity in freshwater
   zooplankton},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {53},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2026-2035},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Regional distribution, frequency of occurrence and relative abundance
   were scored in 2467 Norwegian lakes for all the recorded 130 species of
   crustacean zooplankton. The majority of species were rare in the sense
   that 65\% of species were recorded in fewer than 10\% of localities.
   Only six species were recorded in more than 50\% of localities, and the
   median number of species in a given locality was 14 (i.e. 10\% of the
   total species pool).
   2. Abundances of all species were scored according to the fraction of
   lakes in which they were recorded, their geographical range of
   distribution, and their numerical abundance. Typically the most rare
   species were rare by all three criteria, and vice versa for the common
   species, pointing to rarity as an inherent property of some species. For
   some species this rarity reflects being on the edge of their
   distributional range, while for others rarity seems to be a consequence
   of their life cycle strategies.
   3. Some of the truly rare species have high dispersal rates and high
   colonization abilities, but are rapidly replaced by other species.
   Others are confined to specific habitats, often highly eutrophic,
   pointing to highly specialized niche adaptations.
   4. A major cause for the few truly common species seems to be the
   limited number of species that are able to coexist within a given
   locality, reflecting `the ghost of competition past' and predation
   pressure.
   5. While species composition and species richness may reflect
   colonization abilities and stochastic events, the presence or absence of
   species is not only a random lottery but also a consequence of
   species-specific attributes.},

Abstract = {Based on modelled and measured geophysical variables and
   presence/absence data of eelgrass Zostera marina, we developed a spatial
   predictive probability model for Z. marina. Our analyses confirm
   previous reports and show that the probability of finding Z. marina is
   at its highest in shallow, gently sloping, and sheltered areas. We
   integrated the empirical knowledge from field samples in GIS and
   developed a model-based map of the probability of finding Z. marina
   using the model-selection approach Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
   and the spatial probability modelling extension GRASP in S-Plus. Spatial
   predictive probability models contribute to a better understanding of
   the factors and processes structuring the distribution of marine
   habitats. Additionally, such models provide a useful tool for management
   and research, because they are quantitative and defined objectively,
   extrapolate knowledge from sampled to unsurveyed areas, and result in a
   probability map that is easy to understand and disseminate to
   stakeholders.},

Title = {Habitat differentiation within the large-carnivore community of Norway's

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1382-1391},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to
   increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these
   predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it
   is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances
   and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied
   differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore
   community of south-eastern Norway.
   2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L.,
   Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo
   L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations
   were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis
   aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation
   in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection
   functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected
   probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of
   habitat within the study area.
   3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping
   distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in
   both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was
   generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations,
   whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some
   degree of sympatry was possible in over 40\% of the study area, although
   only 1.5\% could hold all four large carnivores together.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated
   management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable
   populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for
   conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if
   regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational
   gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary
   overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced
   competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the
   conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well
   increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation
   locally.},

Number = {10},
Pages = {1906-1922},

Abstract = {Aim To assess the scale of variation for major environmental gradients
   in Norway. To obtain a step-less model for this variation and to use
   this model to evaluate the extent to which the consensus expert
   classification of Norway into vegetation regions can be predicted from
   environmental variables. To discuss the potential of step-less models
   for understanding natural variation at regional scales, for
   stratification and for predictive modelling of species distributions and
   land-cover types.
   Location The mainland of Norway.
   Methods Fifty-four climatic, topographical, hydrological and geological
   variables were recorded for grid cells with spatial resolution (grain
   size) of 1 x 1, 5 x 5 and 10 x 10 km, spanning the entire mainland of
   Norway. Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to summarize
   variation in three primary data matrices and three random subsets of
   these.
   Results The first four principal components explained between 75\% and
   85\% of the variation in the data sets. All PCAs revealed four
   consistent environmental gradients, in order of decreasing importance:
   (1) regional variation (gradient) from coast to inland and from
   oceanic/humid to continental areas; (2) regional variation from north to
   south and from high to low altitudes; (3) regional variation from north
   to south and from inland to coast, related to solar radiation; and (4)
   topographic (terrain relief) variation on finer scales than (1-3). The
   first two PCA axes corresponded to the two bioclimatic gradients used in
   expert classifications of Norway into biogeographical regions:
   vegetation sections (from highly oceanic to slightly continental) and
   vegetation zones (from nemoral to alpine).
   Main conclusions Our PCA analyses substantiate the current view of

Title = {Summer distribution of wild reindeer in relation to human activity and

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {31},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We examined the summer distribution of 2,500 wild reindeer (Rangifer
   tarandus tarandus) in southern Norway by eight aerial surveys across 8
   years. Most of the reindeer were located at high elevations > 1,400
   m.a.s.l. (88\% of the reindeer in 47\% of the area) where insect stress
   was lower. Within high elevations, reindeer used areas < 5.0 km from
   tourist resorts and major roads and < 2.5 km from hiking trails less
   than expected from availability. A total of 65\% of the reindeer were
   found in high-altitude areas without human development or only including
   closed maintenance roads, which constituted 21\% of the area, likely
   because these areas gave shelter from both insect stress and human
   activity. We conclude that wild reindeer appear to select for insect
   relief areas reaching several kilometers away from human activity if
   such habitat is available. Infrastructure with associated human activity
   was found to be avoided in all surveys.},

Title = {Spatial patterns of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in mosses,
   herbivores and a carnivore from the Norwegian terrestrial biota},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {404},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The widespread occurrence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in
   the environment has attracted considerable attention, leading to
   concerns about the extent and magnitude of wildlife and human exposure.
   In this work, we focus on the occurrence and fate of PBDEs in a
   Norwegian air-plant-herbivore-carnivore system. Specifically, we have
   analysed for PBDEs in moss, livers from various terrestrial herbivores
   (moose, grouse, and European roe deer) and, for the first time, livers
   from the top predator lynx. The samples were collected from different
   sites and time periods (1990-2004) to identify possible spatial and
   temporal trends in contaminant levels and patterns, The general finding
   was that PBDEs were found in all (biotic) samples, although at lower
   concentrations than previously observed in mammals from the marine
   environment. The PBDE levels in the herbivores ranged from less than 0.5
   ng/g lipid weight to 9.4 ng/g lipid weight as the highest. The median
   PBDE concentration in lynx was approximately one order of magnitude
   higher than in the herbivores. In the lynx samples there was a
   predominance of BDE-153 whereas BDE-47 and 99 dominated in the
   herbivores.
   This probably reflects different bioaccumulation properties or metabolic
   transformation processes of the BDE-congeners, and food choice. Levels
   of PBDEs in both moss and herbivores showed a general decline towards
   the northern parts of Norway. No clear temporal trends were observed.
   The PBDE levels observed in this study were low and are probably of
   limited toxicological significance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal area-use patterns of estuarine-dependent
   juvenile dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus in the Great Fish Estuary,
   South Africa, were examined using acoustic telemetry. In all, 29
   individuals (307-400 mm total length) were surgically equipped with
   individually coded transmitters and monitored for a period of up to 195
   days using an array of 11 moored data-logging acoustic receivers. Tagged
   dusky kob spent most time in the estuary (84\%), compared with
   neighbouring marine (13\%) and riverine (4\%) environments. Tagged fish
   made extensive use of the estuary from the mouth to between 6.4 km and
   10.3 km upstream, and spent approximately equal proportions of time at
   each of the seven receivers located between 0.5 km and 6.5 km from the
   mouth. A total of 18 fish undertook sea trips of a mean duration of 3.5
   days, whereas three individuals made riverine excursions (mean duration
   = 7.3 days). A total of 12 (41\%) tagged fish was captured in the
   estuary prior to, during or after the monitoring period. These findings
   highlight the importance of estuaries as critical nursery areas, and
   that the use of these habitats by dusky kob should be better reflected
   in the management arrangements for this fishery species.},

Volume = {37},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article summarizes results from raptor monitoring and contamination
   studies in Norway of the golden eagle, gyrfalcon, white-tailed sea
   eagle, osprey, peregrine, and merlin. Golden eagle and gyrfalcon
   populations have been monitored since 1990 as part of the ``Monitoring
   Programme for Terrestrial Ecosystems{''} (TOV). No long-term trend in
   the population size or productivity of golden eagle has been shown in
   any of the 5 study areas. The reproductive output of gyrfalcon is
   monitored in 3 areas. It is positively correlated with the populations
   of its main prey species, the rock ptarmigan and the willow ptarmigan.
   The white-tailed sea eagle population has been monitored since 1974 by
   the Norwegian Ornithological Society, and the population is increasing.
   The levels of pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls are low in the
   eggs of both the golden eagle and the gyrfalcon, but elevated levels and
   effects on reproduction have been indicated for a coastal subpopulation
   of golden eagle. The pollutant levels in white-tailed sea eagle are
   lower than in the Baltic population of sea eagles, and shell thinning
   was never severe overall, but individual eggs have contained pollutant
   concentrations above critical levels. The levels of pollutants in the
   bird-eating falcons, peregrine, and merlin were higher than in other
   species. New emerging pollutants, like brominated diphenylethers and
   perfluorinated organic compounds, could be detected in all species. By
   incorporating available published and unpublished data, we were able to
   produce time trends for pollutants and shell thickness over 4 decades.},

Title = {Pragmatic management increases a flagship species, the Himalayan brown
   bears, in Pakistan's Deosai National Park},

Abstract = {Deosai Plateau in Northern Pakistan was designated a national park to
   protect the largest remnant population of brown bears in Pakistan. The
   natural resources of this high elevation (3500-5000 m) park make a
   significant contribution to the livelihood of local and nomad
   communities. The present legislation excludes people from a park, which
   increases conflicts between management and local people. However, a
   pragmatic approach was adopted to involve people in conservation in
   Deosai. Community participation, achieved by recognizing rights and
   introducing incentives, reduced resistance against the conservation
   efforts, reduced grazing pressure in bear habitat and helped reduce
   poaching. The size of the brown bear population was set as an indicator
   of park success, and was monitored annually from 1993 through 2006. We
   observed a 5\% annual growth of the brown bear population, suggesting
   that the conservation program has been successful due to a successful
   cooperation between an NGO, people, and the park management.
   The increase of the bear population is significant, because we observed
   an extremely low reproductive rate, due to late age of first
   reproduction (8.25 years), a long reproductive interval (5.7 years), and
   a small litter size (1.33). The reproductive rate of the Deosai
   population is the lowest yet documented for brown bear populations. Poor
   habitat quality, low quality food, high seasonality, and extreme weather
   conditions in the Himalaya probably explain the poor reproductive
   performance. Considering such low reproduction and known exchange of
   individuals with neighboring populations, we believe that the observed
   growth was a sum of reproduction and immigration. Brown bears are
   declining throughout South Asia and often have low-productive rates.
   Therefore, conservation efforts for brown bears in this region must
   target reducing human-caused mortalities, particularly of adult females.
   Involvement of people can increase efficiency in conservation, in
   addition to reducing cost and conflicts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Common Guillemots Uria aalge and Brunnich's Guillemots U. lomvia are
   common victims of oil spills, drowning in fishing nets and winter

   identify the origins of birds killed outside the breeding season.
   Measurements of birds made in nine colonies in the Barents and Norwegian
   Seas showed that although it is impossible to determine with reasonable
   accuracy the colony of origin from body measurements, the most likely
   sea of origin of Common Guillemots may be determined on the basis of

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Within the predator guild, wolverines (Gulo gulo (L., 1758)) have
   evolved as generalist predators and scavengers on prey killed by other
   predators. The recovery of wolves (Canis lupus L., 1758) in the boreal
   forests of southern Norway during the late 1990s may have triggered
   consequent recolonization by wolverines through increased carcass
   availability. We investigated winter foraging behavior of wolverines in
   the boreal forest with regard to wolf, lynx (Lynx lynx (L., 1758)), and
   red fox (Vulpes vulpes (L., 1758)) presence. We followed 55 wolverine
   tracks in the snow from at least nine individuals for a total of 237 km
   during the winters of 2003-2004. We documented 19 moose (Alces alces
   (L., 1758)) and 4 bird carcasses, and no successful hunts. Wolverines
   did not follow guild species trails directly to carcasses; however, they
   did change their movement patterns after red fox encounters. While
   wolverines were more active at higher elevations, the probability of
   encountering a wolf was higher at lower elevations, suggesting a spatial
   separation between wolverines and wolves. Although wolverines seem to
   depend on wolf for carrion during winter, they did not use wolf trails
   to find carcasses. This may indicate that wolverines reduce risk of
   intraguild predation by avoiding direct confrontation with wolves.},

Title = {Evaluation of the importance of roe deer fawns in the spring-summer diet

Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {889-896},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Red fox Vulpes vulpes predation on roe deer Capreolus capreolus fawns
   has the potential to strongly affect prey population dynamics, but it is
   unclear whether this relationship is symmetrical or not. We analysed the
   spring-summer diet of adult foxes and of their cubs in a fragmented
   agricultural area of southeastern Norway, where a parallel study showed
   that the predator kills annually 25\% of the radio-monitored roe deer
   fawns. The overall diet was highly varied and was dominated by small
   mammals (33\% volume), especially Microtus agrestis, and medium-large
   mammals (25\%), largely represented by fawns. The frequency of
   occurrence (FO) of fawns in the diet of adult foxes was highest in early
   spring, thus, supporting previous studies showing that the predator
   started actively hunting for fawns from the very beginning of the birth
   season. During the summer, the FO of both fawns and small mammals
   markedly declined, while that of berries and invertebrates increased. As
   expected for central-place foragers, cubs consumed a higher proportion
   of large prey items compared to adults. In particular, 25\% of scats
   from cubs-versus 9\% from adults-contained roe deer remains, suggesting
   a high profitability of fawns for vixens raising offspring. However,
   considering the wide food spectrum and the availability of several large
   prey items in our study area, it seems unlikely that the importance of
   fawns to the diet and population dynamics of red foxes could be as great
   as the impact of the predator on roe deer populations. This asymmetrical
   relationship implies that there are unlikely to be any stabilising
   feedback mechanisms in the predator-prey relationship.},

Title = {Hormonal regulation of female nuptial coloration in a fish},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {549-556},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Physiological color change in camouflage and mating is widespread among
   fishes, but little is known about the regulation of such temporal
   changes in nuptial coloration and particularly concerning female
   coloration. To better understand regulation of nuptial coloration we
   investigated physiological color change in female two-spotted gobies
   (Gobiusculus flavescens). Females of this species develop an orange
   belly that acts as an ornament. The orange color is caused by the color
   of the gonads combined with the chromathophore based pigmentation and
   transparency of the skin. Often during courtship and female-female
   competition, a rapid increase in orange coloration, in combination with
   lighter sides and back that increases skin and body transparency, gives
   the belly an intense `glowing' appearance. To understand how this
   increased orange coloration can be regulated we analysed chromatic and
   transparency effects of neurohumoral agents on abdominal skin biopsies
   in vitro. We found prolactin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone
   (MSH) to increase orange coloration of the skin. By contrast, melatonin
   and noradrenaline increased skin transparency, but had a negative effect
   on orange coloration. However, mixtures of melatonin and MSH, or
   melatonin and prolactin, increased both orange coloration and
   transparency. This effect mimics the chromatic `glow' effect that
   commonly takes place during courtship and intra sexual aggression.
   Notably, not only epidermal chromatophores but also internal
   chromatophores lining the peritoneum responded to hormone treatments.
   There were no chromatic effects of the sex steroids 17 beta-estradiol,
   testosterone or 11-ketotestosterone. We hypothesize that similar
   modulation of nuptial coloration by multiple hormones may be widespread
   in nature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The River Alta, northern Norway (70 degrees N), was regulated for
   hydropower in 1987. Densities of juveniles and catches of adult Atlantic
   salmon have been studied since 1980-1981 to examine the effects of
   regulation. The need to control environmental variables during
   electrofishing was emphasized, as flow variables explained up to 42\% of
   the variation in estimated juvenile densities. The number of spawning
   redds was counted along the river from 1996 to 2005. The annual number
   of spawning redds was correlated with the catch of multi-sea-winter
   salmon (predominantly females). In the upper 7 km section, just
   downstream of the power station outlet, juvenile densities were reduced
   by 80\% from pre-regulation levels to minimum levels in 1992-1996. This
   was followed by partial recovery during 1997-2005, although not entirely
   back to pre-regulation levels. In contrast, the general trend in the
   middle part of the river was a linear increase in juvenile densities
   during 1981-2005. Decreased juvenile densities in the upper section was
   subsequently followed by reduced catches of adult salmon in this part of
   the river. The relative catches of smolt year classes migrating to sea
   in the upper section was reduced by up to 75\% from 1991 onwards.
   Spawning and recruitment in the upper section have increased in recent
   years, probably back to the introduction of catch-and-release angling
   and an increase in salmon runs. However, present day smolt production in
   the upper section is still reduced compared to the middle part of the
   river, 18 years after regulation. The decreased densities of juvenile
   salmon in the upper section were probably caused by several factors, of
   which stranding mortality due to sudden drops in the water level and
   increased winter mortality due to changed environmental conditions,
   especially reduced ice-cover, may be the most important. In conclusion,
   the regulation caused a considerable reduction of the salmon production
   in the upper 16\% of salmon reaches, but did not affect the salmon
   population negatively further downstream. This study illustrates that
   apparently small environmental disturbances can cause large changes in
   Atlantic salmon abundance in high latitude populations.},

Title = {An efficient multivariate approach for estimating preference when

Abstract = {1. We discuss aspects of resource selection based on observing a given
   vector of resource variables for different individuals at discrete time
   steps. A new technique for estimating preference of habitat
   characteristics, applicable when there are multiple individual
   observations, is proposed.
   2. We first show how to estimate preference on the population and
   individual level when only a single site- or resource component is
   observed. A variance component model based on normal scores in used to
   estimate mean preference for the population as well as the heterogeneity
   among individuals defined by the intra-class correlation.
   3. Next, a general technique is proposed for time series of observations
   of a vector with several components, correcting for the effect of
   correlations between these. The preference of each single component is
   analyzed under the assumption of arbitrarily complex selection of the
   other components. This approach is based on the theory for conditional
   distributions in the multi-normal model.
   4. The method is demonstrated using a data set of radio-tagged
   dispersing juvenile goshawks and their site characteristics, and can be
   used as a general tool in resource or habitat selection analysis.},

Abstract = {Eight hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon Salmo salar post-smolts, implanted
   with acoustic depth sensing transmitters and manually tracked for 5-12 h
   in the Hardangerfjord (Norway), spent most of their time (49-99\%) at
   1-3 m depth during the day, whereas four of seven fish tracked were
   found close (< 0.5 m) to the surface at night, with a strong negative
   cross-correlation between general swimming depth and surface light
   intensity. Hence, the actual swimming depth of post-smolts during their
   early marine migration may depend on the light conditions, although the
   individual variation in vertical movement pattern was large. No
   cross-correlations were found between light intensity and swimming depth
   during daytime periods with rapid changes in light intensity, indicating
   that other factors than light intensity were important in initiating the
   irregular dives that were recorded down to 6.5 in depth. (c) 2008 The

   white fringes in the wing feathers produced one to two months after the
   challenge in female common eiders (Somateria mollissima), a long-lived
   sea duck. Immune-challenged females produced feathers with smaller white
   fringes, showing that a previous immune challenge may affect the
   expression of a plumage trait. We also report an unexpected difference
   in the expression of this white plumage trait within the
   immune-challenged group, related to the specific immune response against
   one of the injected antigens.},

Abstract = {Although there is little doubt that the domestication of mammals was
   instrumental for the modernization of human societies, even basic
   features of the path towards domestication remain largely unresolved for
   many species. Reindeer are considered to be in the early phase of
   domestication with wild and domestic herds still coexisting widely
   across Eurasia. This provides a unique model system for understanding
   how the early domestication process may have taken place. We analysed
   mitochondrial sequences and nuclear microsatellites in domestic and wild
   herds throughout Eurasia to address the origin of reindeer herding and
   domestication history. Our data demonstrate independent origins of
   domestic reindeer in Russia and Fennoscandia. This implies that the
   Saami people of Fennoscandia domesticated their own reindeer
   independently of the indigenous cultures in western Russia. We also
   found that augmentation of local reindeer herds by crossing with wild
   animals has been common. However, some wild reindeer populations have
   not contributed to the domestic gene pool, suggesting variation in
   domestication potential among populations. These differences may explain
   why geographically isolated indigenous groups have been able to make the
   technological shift from mobile hunting to large-scale reindeer
   pastoralism independently.},

Abstract = {Activity rate of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) held in 90 m 2
   littoral enclosures were estimated using bioenergetic (with consumption
   estimated using stable caesium, Cs-133) and behavioural approaches (with
   fish movements quantified using video cameras). We found no
   statistically significant difference between Values of activity rate
   obtained using the two approaches for three of the six experiments we
   performed. However, there was no relationship between estimates of
   activity rate obtained using the two approaches. Discrepancies may arise
   from the difficulty to meet assumptions regarding (lie temporal
   stability of the concentration of Cs-113 in fish diet and of the
   assimilation coefficient of this tracer. When fish remain in all area
   where their behaviour call be well described (e.g., enclosure, habitat
   patches of littoral zones, coral reefs). the behavioural approach
   appears more robust to estimate activity rate because it depends most on
   a variable that is easiest to estimate (the number of movements
   performed). When these conditions are not met (low fish densities or
   major fish migration,), a reliable assessment of the concentration and
   assimilation of Cs-133 in stomach contents appears critical to implement
   the bioenergetic approach based on this tracer.},

Abstract = {Polyfluorinated alkyl compounds (PFCs) are a group of chemicals of
   growing concern that have been detected in biological and abiotic
   samples worldwide. This study reports the concentrations of a suite of
   PFCs: perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctyl sulfonamide
   (PFOSA) and perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in guillemot (Uria
   aalge) eggs, collected in North-Western Europe, from Iceland, the Faroe
   Islands, Sweden and two locations in Norway. The highest concentrations
   of PFOS were found in samples from Sweden (mean 400 ng g(-1) wet weight
   (w.w.)), which were almost five times higher than concentrations found
   in Norwegian samples (mean 85 ng g(-1) w.w. from both sample sites). The
   concentrations found in Icelandic and Faroe samples were lowest (mean 16
   and 15 ng g(-1) w.w., respectively). Only Swedish samples differed
   signiflcantly from the other locations. In general, PFCAs show a
   different spatial trend than PFOS. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was not
   detected in any sample and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was only
   detected in samples from Sweden. The most abundant PFCA was
   perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) with highest concentrations in samples
   from Sweden (mean 82 ng g(-1) w.w.), samples from the Faroe Islands had
   the second highest concentration (mean 57 ng g(-1) w.w.) and samples
   from Iceland and Norway had concentrations ranging between 18 and 30 ng
   g(-1) w.w. The original hypothesis was based on the idea that PFC
   concentrations are the highest close to more densely populated and
   industrialized areas and lower levels in remote areas. However, the
   geographic pattern is more complicated than predicted and varies among
   different PFCs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Impacts of differential prey dynamics on the potential recovery of
   endangered arctic fox populations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1086-1093},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. The arctic fox Vulpes lagopus in Fennoscandia was heavily decimated
   in the early 20th century and has failed to recover despite full
   protection during the last 70 years. On the contrary, since the 1970s
   the population has declined even further and the species is now on the
   verge of regional extinction.
   2. The most recent population decline of the arctic fox in Fennoscandia
   has coincided with some distinct changes in the cyclic population
   dynamics of its key prey, lemmings and voles. Although this coincidence
   of events and the tight trophic connection between foxes and rodents
   suggest that the two phenomena are causally linked, the effects of
   spatio-temporal small rodent dynamics on the viability of arctic fox
   populations have not been fully explored.
   3. Here we address how the mean, temporal variance and the periodicity
   of small rodent population density cycles impact long-term stochastic
   growth rate of arctic fox populations. We do this in a modelling
   framework where the vital rates of the fox are linked to realistic,
   quantitative realizations of small rodent density dynamics.
   4. Arctic fox population growth rate was found to be highly sensitive to
   the temporal mean and to some extent to the variance in small rodent
   density cycles, whereas cycle period in the observed range of 3- to
   5-year cycles was surprisingly of minor importance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis shows that small rodent
   population dynamics characterized by low-amplitude density cycles
   (irrespective of their average cycle period), provide little scope for
   positive population growth, and thus recovery, of the arctic fox. Thus,
   we advise that management actions such as re-introductions and red fox
   Vulpes vulpes control should be conducted in mountain tundra regions
   where regular, high-amplitude cycles, of any period, with recurrent high
   spring densities of rodents still prevail. In order to properly identify
   geographic areas with the highest potential for arctic fox recovery, the
   emphasis of current monitoring programmes of small rodent dynamics needs
   to consider more quantitative metrics than they currently employ.},

Abstract = {Black-legged kittiwakes (BLKIs) reduce self-maintenance cost through
   reductions in mass-specific basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass and
   the size of visceral organs during the chick-rearing period. In the
   present study, we measured kidney in vitro oxygen consumption and plasma
   3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) levels of incubating and chick-rearing
   female BLKIs, to test whether the decrease in BMR is caused mainly by
   decreased metabolic intensity or simply by reductions in the size of
   organs with high metabolic intensity. Body mass and body condition were
   lower in chick-rearing birds compared with the incubating birds. In
   contrast to the previous findings, however, the kidney mass did not
   differ between the two breeding stages. Plasma T3 levels decreased
   substantially during the breeding season, indicating a reduction in BMR.
   Over the same period, kidney mass-specific oxygen consumption decreased
   (by 17.2\%) from the incubating to the chick-rearing stage. Thus, the
   reduction in BMR found in breeding BLKIs seems partly explained by
   adjustments in metabolic intensity of visceral organs. Lowered metabolic
   intensity of visceral organs would permit increased allocation of energy
   to offspring at the expense of their own self-maintenance.},

Title = {Age-specific feeding cessation in male red deer during rut},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {275},
Number = {4},
Pages = {407-412},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tactics for resource-use involve both using stored reserves (capital
   breeding) and feeding while reproducing (income breeding). In polygynous
   ungulates, males often use an income breeding strategy when young and
   shift to a capital breeding tactic at prime age. Little is known
   regarding why prime-aged males stop or largely reduce eating during rut
   but still remain inactive for as much time as before rut. A detailed
   exploration of how rumen content correlates with age and date may shed
   light on the ultimate causes of why some males stop eating. We provide
   quantitative empirical data on rumen content from red deer Cervus
   elaphus during the rutting season in Norway. In male red deer, rumen
   content declined with age, up to around 6 years of age. Above this age,
   rumen content was low and stable. A time-of-year effect on rumen content
   was best described with a second-order polynomial term, as rumen fill
   was lowest during mid-October when the mass loss of males and the
   ovulation rate of females both peak. We present two new hypotheses
   related to why males reduce eating (physical rest and parasite
   hypotheses). Two related patterns need to be explained and better
   documented: (1) why are resting times stable before, after and during
   rut, and (2) why do non-prime-aged males eat more between rutting
   activities?.},

Abstract = {A problem in climate studies has been on how to treat causal chains of
   explanations and both direct and indirect effects. Mammals in strongly
   seasonal environments of the boreal forest typically lose condition
   during winter and gain mass (and reproduce) during the summer season
   when biomass and plant quality peak. Mass decay of large herbivores
   during winter is due to direct effects of winter weather, such as
   increased costs of movement, thermoregulation and reduced access to food
   when snow is deep. Deer condition during summer is thought to be
   affected mainly indirectly by weather through plants. High spring
   temperature speeds up plant development, and deep snow can delay
   phenology in early summer. Current statistical modelling does not take
   into account these mechanistic pathways. We used hierarchical Bayes
   modelling to more mechanistically link global climate, local weather and
   plant phenology to autumn body mass of red deer in Norway. Red deer were
   much more affected indirectly through trophic interactions. No solid
   evidence of direct effects of snow depth was found on autumn body mass.
   We discuss the implications of our results relative to our ability to
   predict effects of global change on large mammalian herbivores in the
   boreal forest.},

Abstract = {In Norway domestic sheep Ovis aries range unattended in mountainous
   areas during the summer season. Wolverines Gulo gulo re-established in
   the alpine regions of southern Norway during recent decades and are
   viewed as a substantial predator on lambs. Reducing predation on sheep
   by wolverines would not only reduce the economic loss to farmers but
   also promote the acceptance of wolverines in their summer ranges. We
   hypothesized that male lambs would be more prone to wolverine predation,
   because of higher locomotor activity, lower behavioural ewe-lamb
   synchrony and larger ewe-lamb distance. We studied ewe and lamb
   behavioural patterns, synchrony and ewe-lamb distance on a summer range
   in Knutshoi, south-central Norway. Although no differences were found in
   ewe-lamb distance or locomotor activity in gender, female lambs
   synchronized their behaviour more with their mother than males. Only for
   female lambs, increased synchrony resulted in closer ewe-lamb distances.
   Overall losses to wolverines based on long-term data indicate that male
   lambs are more prone to predation than females later in the season.
   These sex-specific behavioural differences in lambs affect the spatial
   and social relationships between ewe and lamb, and are likely to
   increase with age eventually leading to sexual segregation. Male lambs
   can therefore be expected to be more prone to wolverine predation
   towards the end of the season, when lambs become independent from the
   ewe. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Survival from fledging to maturity is an important life-history
   parameter in long-lived species such as seabirds. However, because of
   the long period of unobservability following fledging, few studies have
   reported reliable estimates of survival rates for immatures. We
   estimated survival to maturity of two cohorts of Atlantic Puffin
   (Fratercula arctica) fledglings from Hornoya in northern Norway using
   capture-mark-recapture methodology. By considering only juveniles that
   actually left their nest burrows, we arrived at unbiased estimates Of
   Survival rates for immatures. Contrary to many previous studies, annual
   Survival of immatures was not depressed in relation to adult survival.
   13), the age of five years, more than two-thirds of all fledglings are
   still estimated to be alive. Averaged over this period, ani-Mal survival
   of immatures is estimated as 0.933 (95\% confidence interval:
   0.806-0.993). This compares to an annual adult Survival of 0.943
   (0.909-0.965) during the same period. The survival estimates also imply
   that the cohorts Studied are overwhelmingly philopatric. Dispersal of
   immatures must be extremely rare or absent. The annual estimates of
   resighting reveal a clear age-related pattern, including a peak at three
   years of age and a Subsequent minimum at six years of age. Possible
   biological explanations for this behavior are given.},

Abstract = {We found that synchronous fluctuations of two congeneric seabird species
   across the entire Arctic and sub-Arctic regions were associated with
   changes in sea surface temperatures (SST) that were linked to two
   climate shifts, in 1977 and again in 1989. As the SST changes linked to
   climate shifts were congruent at the scale of ocean basins, fluctuations
   of these species occurred similarly at continental or basin scale.
   Changes in colony sizes were examined for a decade following climate
   shifts. The magnitude of the SST shift was more important than its
   direction in determining the subsequent rate of population change.
   Seabirds declined when the SST shift was large and increased when the
   shift was small, although the effect differed between the
   Arctic-breeding species and the more temperate-breeding congener. The
   Arctic species, Thick-billed Murre (Uria lomvia) increased most rapidly
   when SST warmed slightly, while the temperate species, Common Murre
   (Uria aalge) showed most rapid increase with moderate cooling. Both
   showed negative trends with large temperature shifts in either
   direction. This pattern was replicated during both climate oscillations.
   Negative population trends in seabirds presumably indicate the
   alteration of underlying food webs. Hence, similar widespread
   fluctuations in response to climate shifts are likely for other
   ecosystem components (marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates).},

Title = {Dispersal and demography contributions to population spread of Carduus
   nutans in its native and invaded ranges},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {96},

Pages = {687-697},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Invasive species usually exhibit different spatial population
   dynamics in their native and invaded range. This is often attributed to
   demographic differences, but may be due to differences in dispersal as
   well.
   2. Regardless of how these dispersal and demographic differences from
   the native range arose, studying how they contributed to increases in
   population spread rates will increase our understanding of what has made
   these species invasive. Here we investigate which vital rates and
   dispersal parameters of the invasive thistle Carduus nutans drive the
   increases in spread rate in different invaded ranges compared to that in
   the native range in Eurasia.
   3. We construct and analyse spatial integrodifference models that
   combine structured, local population models with mechanistic (WALD)
   models of seed dispersal by wind across a homogeneous landscape.
   Published and new demographic and dispersal data for single populations
   from the native (France) and invaded (Australia, New Zealand, Kansas and
   Pennsylvania) ranges were used for the parameterization.
   4. We developed a variance decomposition method (c{*}-LTRE) to analyse
   the contributions of the changes in the vital rates and dispersal
   parameters to the increases in the invasion wave speed (c{*}) estimates
   for the different invaded ranges compared to that for the native range.
   5. The c{*}-LTRE analysis showed that the net contribution of the
   dispersal parameters to c{*} increases varied among the populations from
   51\% (Australia), to 79\% (Kansas), to 80\% (New Zealand) and to 85\%
   (Pennsylvanian experiment). Escape from natural enemies that reduce seed
   set by floral herbivory was important in all invaded ranges. Large
   positive contributions were also made by increases in rapid growth of
   seedlings and small rosettes, increases in flowering probabilities and
   potential seed production, as well as by increased plant height and
   lower falling velocities of the plumed seeds.
   6. Synthesis. By incorporating a mechanistic dispersal model with a
   structured population model, and by linking this joint model to field
   data from several continents, we demonstrate the relative importance of
   dispersal and demography to invasion success. This approach can be used
   to analyse which aspects of an invader's life history have changed most
   importantly from the native range.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-95},

Abstract = {A study was undertaken to examine the responses of three Atlantic salmon
   Salmo salar strains to growth hormone (GH) treatment. A positive growth
   response to sustained-release GH implants was found in two wild strains
   (Namsen and Imsa) as well as one domesticated strain (AquaGen). The data
   revealed that the growth-selected AquaGen strain has further growth
   potential, however, a stronger growth response was observed in the wild
   strains which outgrew the domesticated strain after GH treatment. These
   observations suggest that some growth potential may have been lost
   during the selection for rapid growth in the AquaGen strain. In
   September, the parr were GH implanted and in December sampled for plasma
   GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels, liver, muscle and
   gill GH receptor, IGF-I mRNA levels, gill Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity,
   muscle and liver lipid content and body silvering. Low temperature and
   seasonal growth cessation probably explains the relatively limited GH
   effects found. Body silvering in all strains was positively correlated
   to size. GH increased IGF-I plasma levels in the Namsen strain inspite
   of liver IGF-I mRNA levels being lower in GH-treated fish. (c) 2008 The

Abstract = {Most ground nesters lay pigmented eggs, and egg pigmentation generally
   matches the environment. Pigmentation of eggs has evolved as a
   protective device against predation, but dark-pigmented eggs can be
   susceptible to overheating when exposed to solar radiation. The Ostrich
   (Struthio camelus) lays white eggs that are unattended for the first few
   weeks before incubation, and are quite visible to predators. To evaluate
   the effect of colour on the surface and core temperatures, we painted
   some Ostrich eggs dark brown or white, and left some unpainted
   (control), and exposed all of them directly to the sun during the day.
   The surface and core temperatures of brown eggs were significantly
   higher than those of the white-painted and control eggs. In addition,
   the core temperature of brown eggs exceeded 37.5 degrees C, which is the
   temperature at which embryo mortality starts to increase. In a second
   experiment, we placed eggs (brown-painted and control) in various types
   of vegetation to study their visibility to an observer walking towards
   them. The white eggs were discovered from a significantly longer
   distance than the brown eggs, indicating that the predation risk may be
   much higher for white eggs. The results thus suggest that white eggs
   minimise overheating and allow the Ostrich to leave its eggs unattended
   before incubation starts, but they are more susceptible to predation.},

Abstract = {Valproate (VPA) is a major antiepileptic drug with a broad spectrum of
   antiepileptic activity. There is, however, increasing concern about the
   possible effects of VIA on reproductive endocrine function. This study
   investigated the effects of valproate, on the endocrine and reproductive
   system of adolescent, non-epileptic, goat bucks. Nine goat bucks were
   orally treated with 62.5 mg/kg valproate twice daily from 2 to 10 months
   of age in order to sustain therapeutic plasma concentrations of between
   300 and 600 mu mol/l. Seven bucks served as controls. Body weights and
   testicular diameters were recorded. Blood samples were collected for
   measurement of luteinising hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone
   (FSH) and testosterone three times weekly until sacrifice at
   approximately 40 weeks of age. Conventional reproductive endpoints were
   recorded and flow cytometric (FCM) analyses of spermatogenesis,
   including the sperm chromatin structure were conducted.
   Valproate-treated bucks had on average a higher body weight, but a lower
   testis diameter than controls. No significant differences were found for
   plasma FSH in comparison to controls. Valproate-treated bucks differed
   significantly from the control group by showing lower plasma
   concentrations of LH and testosterone and a later onset of puberty. A
   significantly higher proportion of sperm from valproate-treated bucks
   showed abnormal chromatin, demonstrating a harmful effect on DNA from
   valproate treatment. These results demonstrate that valproate was able
   to induce reproductive effects in goat bucks related to the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-axis, as well as to the testes. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {With growing concerns about the impact of selective harvesting on
   natural populations, researchers encourage managers to implement harvest
   regimes that avoid or minimize the potential for demographic and
   evolutionary side effects. A seemingly intuitive recommendation is to
   implement harvest regimes that mimic natural mortality patterns. Using
   stochastic simulations based on a model of risk as a logistic function
   of a normally distributed biological trait variable, we evaluate the
   validity of this recommendation when the objective is to minimize the
   altering effect of harvest on the immediate post-mortality distribution
   of the trait. We show that, in the absence of compensatory mortality,
   harvest mimicking natural mortality leads to amplification of the
   biasing effect expected after natural mortality, whereas an unbiased
   harvest does not alter the post-mortality trait distribution that would
   be expected in the absence of harvest. Although our approach focuses
   only on a subset of many possible objectives for harvest management, it
   illustrates that a single strategy, such as hunting mimicking natural
   mortality, may be insufficient to address the complexities of different
   management objectives with potentially conflicting solutions.},

Abstract = {Species delimitation is fundamental to many areas of biology, and in
   cases where taxonomic status has not been sufficiently clarified the
   ramifications can be as serious as extinction due to the failure to
   implement conservation measures. Since 1931, the Mountain Hawk Eagle
   Nisaetus (Spizaetus) nipalensis Hodgson has included the allopatric Sri
   Lankan and southern Indian taxon N. kelaarti (Legge) as a subspecies,
   and its taxonomic status has not been re-evaluated. We found that N.
   kelaarti differs considerably from N. nipalensis in its relatively much
   larger bill and claws and short primary projection, and that it also
   differs consistently in numerous plumage characters and other mensural
   characters. Its vocalizations differ distinctly, and an earlier study
   found a moderate degree of genetic differentiation (4.4\% in cyt b and
   3.1\% in CR) from N. nipalensis. The available evidence thus strongly
   and unambiguously supports the specific distinctness of N. kelaarti.},

Abstract = {In Serengeti fire is used as a management tool to improve the forage
   quality for large herbivores. However, little is known of the effects of
   fire on grazing resources particularly sward structure, its influence on
   herbivore forage patch selection and utilization to the relative amount
   of phytomass consumed in burnt and nonburnt patches. From September 2003
   to July 2004, consumption of phytomass by large herbivores was assessed
   with eight samplings in six grassland sites in the Western Corridor in
   Serengeti National Park. Each site had burnt and nonburnt plots. Movable
   cages were used to exclude grazing between samplings and plant material
   harvests were used to assess phytomass and sward structure changes in
   time. Nonburnt grasslands had consistently larger phytomass at all
   sampling events whereas the ratio for live leaf/total phytomass was
   higher in burnt grassland at early postfire stages, but declined later
   in the season. Moreover, periodic consumption of both total phytomass
   and different phytomass components shifted between burnt and nonburnt
   grasslands, but there were also large site-specific responses. The shift
   appears to be related to the balance between the amount of phytomass
   available and the quality of the forage in terms of the ratio between
   live and total phytomass. The study highlights the significance of
   maintaining mosaics of burnt and nonburnt areas with an adequate
   provision of forage amount and quality all year round.},

Abstract = {Although the acid sensitivity of many invertebrate species in lakes is
   well known, methods for assessment of lake acidification based on
   macroinvertebrate samples are less developed than for rivers. This
   article analyses a number of existing metrics developed for assessment
   of river acidification, and evaluates their performance for assessment
   of lake acidification. Moreover, new species-based indicators of lake
   acidification were developed and tested. The selected dataset contains
   668 samples on littoral macroinvertebrates from 427 lakes with almost
   60\% of the samples from Sweden and the rest from UK and Norway.
   Flexible, non-parametric regression models were used for explorative
   analyses of the pressure-response relationships. The metrics have been
   assessed according to their response to pH, the degree of non-linearity
   of the response and the influence of humic compounds. Acid-sensitive
   metrics often showed a threshold in response to pH between 5.8 and 6.5.
   Highly acid-tolerant metrics were typically dominant across the whole pH
   range. Humic level had a positive effect for most acid-sensitive
   metrics. Generally, most metrics showed a more non-linear response
   pattern for the humic lakes than for clear lakes. The significant
   relationship between these macroinvertebrate metrics and acidification
   shows that there is a potential for developing further the assessment
   systems for ecological quality of lakes based on these metrics, although
   the metrics explained a low \% of the variation (< 30\%). In order to
   improve the predictive power of the biotic metrics across the acidified
   part of Europe, further harmonization and standardisation of sampling
   effort and taxa identification are needed.},

Abstract = {A regional data set on water chemistry from 1995 was used to set
   critical values for the survival of brown trout in Norwegian lakes (n =
   790) in relation to pH, inorganic Al and acid neutralizing capacity
   (ANC). ANC was estimated both traditionally (ANC(trad)) and modified by
   treating one-third of the dissolved organic matter as part of the strong
   acid anions (ANC(mod)). The threshold value to avoid fish damage
   (ANC(limit)) was compared with that found in a similar study from 1986.
   Brown trout populations were categorized as unaffected, damaged or
   extinct on the basis of questionnaires. In 1995, threshold values to
   avoid fish damage on the basis of ANC(trad) and ANC(mod) were 67 and 48
   mu eq l(-1), respectively, compared with 20 and 8 mu eq l(-1),
   respectively, in 1986. The higher ANC(limit) found for the data from
   1995 is probably caused by a lower pH and a higher inorganic Al
   concentration at a given ANC value in 1995 than in the 1980s. ANC(limit)
   was highly related to organic carbon concentrations in the study lakes,
   being estimated at 33, 73 and > 100 mu eq l(-1) for three different TOC
   categories (< 2 mg C l(-1), 2-5 mg C l(-1) and > 5 mg C l(-1)). These
   differences in ANC(limit) are due to lower pH and higher concentrations
   of inorganic Al in humic lakes than in clear water lakes at the same
   level of ANC. It is suggested that the change in ANC(limit) for fish in
   acidified lakes is linked to increased concentrations of TOC in recent
   years.},

Abstract = {The objective of this synthesis is to present the key messages and draw
   the main conclusions from the work on lakes in the REBECCA project,
   pointing out their links to theoretical ecology and their applicability
   for the WFD implementation. Type-specific results were obtained from
   analyses of large pan-European datasets for phytoplankton, macrophytes,
   macroinvertebrates and fish, and indicators and relationships showing
   the impact of eutrophication or acidification on these biological
   elements were constructed. The thresholds identified in many of the
   response curves are well suited for setting ecological status class
   boundaries and can be applied in the intercalibration of classification
   systems. Good indicators for phytoplankton (chrysophytes, cyanobacteria)
   and macrophytes (isoetids and charaphytes) responses to eutrophication
   were identified, and the level of eutrophication pressure needed to
   reach the thresholds for these indicators was quantified. Several
   existing metrics developed for macrophytes had low comparability and
   need further harmonisation to be useful for intercalibration of
   classification systems. For macroinvertebrates, a number of metrics
   developed for rivers turned out to be less useful to describe lake
   responses to eutrophication and acidification, whereas other species
   based indicators were more promising. All the biological elements showed
   different responses in different lake types according to alkalinity and
   humic substances, and also partly according to depth. Better
   harmonisation of monitoring methods is needed to achieve better
   precision in the dose-response curves. Future research should include
   impacts of hydromorphological pressures and climate change, as well as
   predictions of timelags involved in responses to reduction of pressures.},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {593-601},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {One particular challenge in reducing the loss of biodiversity by 2010,
   as agreed on at the Earth Summit in 2002, is to assign conservation
   tasks to geographic or administrative entities (e.g., countries or
   regions) on different geographical scales. To identify conservation
   tasks, it is imperative to determine the importance of a specific area
   for the global survival of a species. So far, these national or
   subnational responsibilities for the conservation of species have been
   included differently in methods prioritizing conservation. We reviewed
   how 12 European and 3 non-European methods determined national
   conservation responsibilities and evaluated the international importance
   of a biological population. Different countries used different
   methodologies, which made a direct comparison of assessments of national
   responsibilities among countries extremely difficult Differences existed
   in the importance criteria used. Criteria included population decline,
   range reduction, rarity status, degree of isolation of a population,
   endemism, proportional distribution, and geographic location. To
   increase comparability, it is imperative to develop criteria for which
   data are generally available and to standardize the methodology among
   countries. A standardized method would allow conservation decisions to
   be based on the conservation status of a species and on the
   responsibility of a geographic or administrative entity for the survival
   of a species. We suggest that such a method should use a scalable index
   of proportional distribution, taxonomic status, and the distribution
   pattern of a taxon or species as key elements. Such a method would allow
   for the creation of hierarchical lists and would be highly relevant for
   parts of the world with multiple political jurisdictions or state unions
   and for nations with regional governmental structures. Conservation
   priorities could then be reasonably set by combining national
   responsibility assessments with the international conservation status of
   a species.},

Abstract = {Protein-bound perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and lipid-soluble
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorines (OCs) were
   measured in whole blood from a large number (n = 83) of breeding lesser
   black-backed gulls (Larusfuscus) caught during two distinct sampling
   periods in a colony on the coast of northern Norway. We analyzed 14 PFCs
   (seven were detected in more than 75\% of samples), 10 PBDEs (only BDE
   47 was detected), and 27 OCs, including 12 polychlorinated biphenyl
   (PCB) congeners (14 OCs were detected). Median total PFC concentration
   was higher than median total OC concentration (43 vs 39 ng/g wet wt).
   Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFC (mean relative
   contribution of PFOS to total contaminant concentration in blood
   {[}Sigma total contaminants] was 38\%), whereas total PCB (26\% of Sigma
   total contaminants) and p,p'-DDE
   (2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene; 13\% of Sigma total
   contaminants) were the dominant OCs. No covariability was found between
   protein-bound and lipid-soluble compounds; individuals with high
   concentrations of PFCs did not have high concentrations of OCs or BDE
   47. The concentrations of PFCs were lower in birds caught during the
   late sampling period compared to those of the early period, and females
   had lower levels of some PFCs compared with males, suggesting that
   females sequester fluorinated substances into eggs. For lipid-soluble
   compounds, no significant sex or sampling period differences were found,
   except that trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, and p,p'-DDE concentrations
   were lower in birds caught during the late sampling period. The pattern
   of PFC compounds (relative to PFOS) and lipid-soluble compounds
   (relative to PCB 153) differed between sampling periods in females but
   not in males. Finally, PFCs were distributed more uniformly within the
   population than the lipid-soluble compounds, for which the distributions
   were strongly negatively skewed.},

Abstract = {Telemetry methods were used to investigate the influence of selected
   environmental variables on the position and movement of an
   estuarine-dependent haemulid, the spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii
   (Lacepede 1801), in the Great Fish Estuary, South Africa. Forty
   individuals (263-698 mm TL) were surgically implanted with acoustic
   coded transmitters and manually tracked during two periods (7 February
   to 24 March 2003; n = 20 and 29 September to 15 November 2003; n = 20).
   Real-time data revealed that spotted grunter are euryhaline (0-37) and
   are able to tolerate large variations in turbidity (4-356 FTU) and
   temperature (16-30 degrees C). However, the fish altered their position
   in response to large fluctuations in salinity, temperature and
   turbidity, which are characteristic of tidal estuarine environments.
   Furthermore, tidal phase had a strong influence on the position of
   spotted grunter in the estuary. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Predicting population responses to restoration of breeding habitat in
   Atlantic salmon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {930-938},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Habitat degradation is seriously threatening stream biodiversity and
   productivity world-wide. For salmonid fish, restoration projects in
   disturbed systems commonly aim at increasing the availability of
   suitable breeding habitats, but expectations of effects on population
   abundance based on explicit models are lacking.
   2. We used a spatial population model to predict how breeder dispersion
   may influence population dynamics of salmonids. Simulations involved
   changing the relative abundance of habitat suitable for two juvenile
   size classes (small fry and larger parr), the type of density-dependent
   regulation (effects on survival only vs. effects on survival and growth)
   and intercohort competitive mechanisms.
   3. Increased breeding dispersion could alter patterns of
   density-dependent mortality and increase equilibrium adult abundance and
   maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, there was a strong interaction
   between stage-specific habitat abundance and breeding dispersion. The
   most pronounced effects of breeding dispersion were observed under
   intermediate levels of fry habitat abundance.
   4. When fry habitat was abundant, density-dependent mortality was most
   intense during the parr stage, and increased breeding dispersion did not
   increase adult abundance or MSY. In fact, when populations were
   regulated in the parr stage, increased breeding dispersion could cause
   decreased adult abundance because of the effects of intercohort
   competition. This negative effect only occurred, however, when
   competition among juveniles was symmetric (no age or size advantage).
   5. Synthesis and applications. The population effects of restoring
   breeding habitat can differ among environments, and we have demonstrated
   how these differences can be understood in the light of stage-specific
   density dependence. Increasing spatial dispersion of breeders may often
   be an efficient measure for conserving threatened populations and
   increasing yields in fished populations. However, if direct evidence or
   habitat considerations suggest that fish populations experience
   density-dependent mortality during the parr stage, attempts to increase
   abundance through increased breeding distribution or artificial stocking
   should be avoided, as these are likely to be ineffective or even
   detrimental. The difference between fishing rates providing maximum
   sustainable yield and extinction is particularly small for such
   populations, suggesting that fish managers should adopt a conservative
   and flexible regulation regime.},

Abstract = {We review recent progresses made in the study of fish distribution and
   survival over space - i.e., fisheries spatial ecology. This is achieved
   by first surveying the most common statistical approaches and relative
   challenges associated with the analysis of fisheries spatial data,
   loosely grouped in geostatistical and regression approaches. Then we
   review a selected number of case-studies implementing the discussed
   techniques. We conclude by proposing new areas of statistical and
   ecological research to further our understanding of how fish distribute
   and survive in space. This review serves a dual purpose by emphasizing
   the scientific importance of studying spatial interactions to better
   understand the temporal dynamics of fish abundance, and by promoting the
   development of new analytical and ecological approaches for the analysis
   of spatial data. Through our survey we cover different statistical
   techniques, marine ecosystems and life stages. This analytical,
   geographic and ontogenetic variety is also purposely selected to
   highlight the importance of comparative and multidisciplinary studies
   across diverging ecological disciplines, ecosystems and life stages.
   Besides having a general ecological relevance this review also bears a
   more applied significance, owing to the increasing need for protecting
   renewable marine resources along with their primary habitat. (c) 2007

Abstract = {Factors influencing estuarine use and marine excursions by spotted
   grunter Pomadasys commersonnii in the Great Fish Estuary, South Africa,
   were studied using manual and automated telemetry methods. In all, 20
   individuals, ranging from 362 mm to 698 mm total length (TL), were
   caught and tagged with acoustic-coded transmitters in the estuary.
   Tagged individuals spent most time in the estuary (67\%), interspersed
   with a number of marine excursions - 15 in all. The number (6-53) and
   mean duration (0.8-9.5 days) of sea excursions varied among individuals,
   and were correlated significantly with tide, time of day, fish size and
   various environmental conditions. On average, fish departed the estuary
   on the outgoing tide at night and returned to the estuary on the
   incoming tide during the day. Spotted grunter < 400 mm TL spent more
   time in the estuary than larger fish (403-698 mm TL). The number of fish
   recorded in the estuary was significantly correlated with barometric
   pressure, wind direction and sea temperature. The spotted grunter under
   study exhibited a high degree of estuarine use, highlighting the
   importance of this habitat to this overexploited, estuarine-dependent

Abstract = {Many conclusions about mammalian ranging behaviour have been drawn based
   on minimum convex polygon (MCP) estimates of home range size, although
   several studies have revealed its unpredictable nature compared to that
   of the kernel density estimator. We investigated to what extent the
   choice of home range estimator affected the biological interpretation in
   comparative studies. We found no discrepancy when the question asked
   covered a wide range of taxa, as real and very large differences in
   range size were likely to have masked smaller differences due to the
   choice of home range estimator. However, when the question asked
   concerned within-species characteristics, the choice of home range
   estimator explained as much of the variation in range size as did the
   ecological variable in question. The implications for macro-ecological
   and intraspecific studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {An ex vivo gill EROD assay was applied in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) as
   a biomarker for waterborne CYP1A-inducing compounds derived from oil
   production at sea. Exposure to nominal concentrations of 1 ppm or 10 ppm
   North Sea crude oil in a static water system for 24 h caused a
   concentration-dependent gill EROD induction. Further, exposure of cod
   for 14 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of produced water
   (PW, diluted 1:200 or 1: 1000) from a platform in the North Sea using a
   flow-through system resulted in a concentration-dependent induction of
   gill EROD. Crude oil (0.2 ppm) from the same oil field also proved to
   induce EROD. Finally, gill EROD activity in cod caged for 6 weeks at
   500-10000 m from two platforms Outside Norway was measured. The
   activities in these fish were very low and did not differ from those in
   fish caged at reference sites. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Three approaches to estimate wolf Canis lupus predation rates on moose

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {335-346},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We employed three different methods to estimate predation rates on moose
   in a newly colonized wolf territory in Norway. In the first two methods,
   we estimated predation rates based on the difference in calf/cow ratios
   outside and inside the wolf pack territory from (1) hunter observations
   and (2) aerial surveys. In the last method, (3) we estimated loss of
   calves of radio-collared cows inside and outside the wolf pack
   territory. The difference in mortality rates estimated between the area
   subject to predation and the area outside the wolf pack territory
   essentially constitutes the additive component of predation. We also
   tested the sensitivity of violating the assumptions of methods 1 and 2
   related to equal fecundity and mortality because of other factors than
   predation inside and outside the wolf pack territory. Predation rates
   varied considerably between years and methods used, with hunter
   observations (method 1) giving the lowest and aerial surveys (method 2)
   giving the highest estimates. Method 3 (radio telemetry) was the most
   direct assessment of predation and probably the best approach to
   estimate predation rates in moose. However, all three methods show the
   same yearly changes and may therefore be appropriate to question trends
   trough time or between areas.},

Title = {Adaptive landscapes and density-dependent selection in declining

   disturbance},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-251},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Theory suggests an important role for population density in shaping
   adaptive landscapes through density-dependent selection. Here, we
   identify five methodological approaches for studying such selection,
   review the existing empirical evidence for it, and ask whether current
   declines in abundance can be expected to trigger evolutionary responses
   in salmonid fishes. Across taxa we find substantial amounts of evidence
   for population density influencing the location of adaptive peaks for a
   range of traits, and, in the presence of frequency dependence, changing
   the shape of selection (stabilizing versus disruptive). For salmonids,
   biological and theoretical considerations suggest that the optimal value
   of a number of traits associated with juvenile competitive ability (e.
   g. egg size, timing of emergence from nests, dominance ability), may
   depend on population density. For adults, more direct experimental and
   comparative evidence suggest that secondary sexual traits can be subject
   to density-dependent selection. There is also evidence that density
   affects the frequency-dependent selection likely responsible for the
   expression of alternative male reproductive phenotypes in salmon. Less
   is known however about the role of density in maintaining genetic
   variation among juveniles. Further efforts are required to elucidate the
   indirect evolutionary effects of declining population abundances, both
   in salmonids and in other anthropogenically challenged organisms.},

Title = {Prevalence and diversity of Lyme borreliosis bacteria in marine birds},
Journal = {INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {352-359},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A potential role of seabirds in spreading Lyme disease (LB) spirochetes
   over large spatial scales was suggested more than 10 years ago when
   Borrelia garinii was observed in marine birds of both hemispheres. Since
   then, there have been few studies examining the diversity of Borrelia
   spp. circulating in seabirds, or the potential interaction between
   terrestrial and marine disease cycles. To explore these aspects, we
   tested 402 Ixodes uriae ticks collected from five colonial seabird
   species by amplification of the flaB gene. Both the average prevalence
   (26.0\% +/- 3.9) and diversity of LB spirochetes was high. Phylogenetic
   analyses grouped marine isolates in two main clades: one associated with
   B. garinii and another with B. lusitaniae, a genospecies typically
   associated with lizards. One sequence also clustered most closely with
   B. burgdorferi! sensu stricto. Prevalence in ticks varied both among
   seabird species within colonies and among colonies. However, there was
   no clear association between different Borrelia isolates and a given
   seabird host species. Our findings indicate that LB spirochetes
   circulating in the marine system are more diverse than previously
   described and support the hypothesis that seabirds may be an important
   component in the global epidemiology and evolution of Lyme disease.
   Future work should help determine the extent to which isolates are
   shared between marine and terrestrial systems. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {The timing of male reproductive effort relative to female ovulation in a
   capital breeder},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {469-477},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In large herbivores, the timing of breeding is important for females to
   hit peak plant protein levels. For males, the timing of reproductive
   effort is important to maximize the number of females they can mate
   during autumn rut in competition with other males. The latter depends on
   when most females are ovulating, but also on how other males with a
   different competitive ability are timing use of their capital (fat); it
   may pay younger males to invest more heavily later when prime aged males
   are exhausted.
   Based on estimates of body mass loss, we quantify how much timing
   (start, peak and end dates) of male reproductive effort during rutting
   varies depending on male age, density and climate as well as timing of
   female ovulation.
   Ovulation in adult females was delayed by 5 days from low to high
   density, and ovulation was also more synchronous at high density. The
   starting date of decline in male body mass was only later in yearlings
   than among other age groups. However, at low density, peak and end dates
   of rut became increasingly earlier and close to peak female ovulation
   with increasing age up to 7 years of age. Prime-aged males matched peak
   effort closely with peak rate of prime-aged female ovulation, while
   younger males were delayed. This is consistent with the view that
   younger males have a better chance when the prime-aged males are
   becoming exhausted.
   Apart from yearlings, male age groups were synchronized in both the
   starting, peak and end dates of mass decline at high density. Thus, this
   partly follows change in female ovulation patterns, but also suggests
   that competition among males decreased with increasing density due
   probably to lower intensity of sexual selection. The lowered sexual
   selection may be due not only to more synchronous female ovulation, but
   also increasingly female-biased sex ratios and a younger male age
   structure with increasing density.
   The onset of rutting is somewhat independent of male age (apart from the
   youngest males), but the peak and end of rutting effort is dependent
   strongly upon age, density and peak female ovulation. Male rutting
   phenology is thus best interpreted as a compromise between hitting peak
   female ovulation and intensity of sexual selection.},

Abstract = {Indices of the monthly post-smolt growth of three maturity groups of
   Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from the Drammen River in Norway were
   examined. Scale samples were collected from 1983 to 2003, providing a
   retrospective growth history for 2854 individuals. Overall post-smolt
   growth of all three maturity groups decreased throughout the study
   period. When the post-smolt year was segmented into 8 monthly indices,
   there was a significant decline in growth during the fourth and fifth
   month, typically months of maximum growth. The pre-fishery abundance of
   one and two sea-winter fish from Norway also showed a decline throughout
   the study period and was positively correlated to the post-smolt growth
   of fish returning to the Drammen River. Freshwater growth was negatively
   correlated to the pre-fishery abundance, thus indicating that factors
   affecting post-smolt growth during the fourth and fifth months at sea
   may be responsible for declining return numbers in Norway.},

Title = {Summer kill rates and predation pattern in a wolf-moose system: can we
   rely on winter estimates?},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {156},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-64},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {So far the vast majority of studies on large carnivore predation,
   including kill rates and consumption, have been based on winter studies.
   Because large carnivores relying on ungulates as prey often show a
   preference for juveniles, kill rates may be both higher and more
   variable during the summer season than during the rest of the year
   leading to serious underestimates of the total annual predation rate.
   This study is the first to present detailed empirical data on kill rates
   and prey selection in a wolf-moose system during summer (June-September)
   as obtained by applying modern Global Positioning System-collar
   techniques on individual wolves (Canis lupus) in Scandinavia. Moose
   (Alces alces) was the dominant prey species both by number (74.4\%) and
   biomass (95.6\%); 89.9\% of all moose killed were juveniles,
   representing 76.0\% of the biomass consumed by wolves. Kill rate in
   terms of the kilogram biomass/kilogram wolf per day averaged 0.20
   (range: 0.07-0.32) among wolf territories and was above, or well above,
   the daily minimum food requirements in most territories. The average
   number of days between moose kills across wolf territories and study
   periods was 1.71 days, but increased with time and size of growing moose
   calves during summer. Over the entire summer (June-September, 122 days),
   a group (from two to nine) of wolves killed a total of 66 (confidence
   interval 95\%; 56-81) moose. Incorporation of body growth functions of
   moose calves and yearlings and wolf pups over the summer period showed
   that wolves adjusted their kill rate on moose, so the amount of
   biomass/kilogram wolf was relatively constant or increased. The kill
   rate was much higher (94-116\%) than estimated from the winter period.
   As a consequence, projecting winter kill rates to obtain annual
   estimates of predation in similar predator-prey systems may result in a
   significant underestimation of the total number of prey killed.},

Title = {Assessment of species diversity from species abundance distributions at

Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {117},
Number = {5},
Pages = {738-748},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We show how the spatial structure of species diversity can be analyzed
   using the correlation between the log abundances of the species in the
   communities, assuming that two communities at different localities can
   be described by a bivariate lognormal species abundance distribution. A
   useful property of this approach is that the log abundances of the
   species at two localities can be considered as samples from a bivariate
   normal distribution defined by only five parameters. The variances and
   the correlation can be estimated by maximum likelihood methods even if
   there is no information about the sampling intensity and the number of
   unobserved species. This method also enables estimation of
   over-dispersion in the sampling relative to a Poisson distribution that
   allows sampling adjustment of the estimate of beta-diversity.
   Furthermore, we also obtain a partitioning of species diversity into
   additive components of alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity. For instance,
   if the correlation between the log abundances of the species is close to
   one, the same species will be common and rare in the two communities and
   the beta-diversity will be low. We illustrate this approach by analysing
   similarities of communities of rare and endangered species of oak-living
   beetles in south-eastern Norway. The number of recorded species was
   estimated to be only 48.1\% of the total number of species actually
   present in these communities. The correlations among communities dropped
   rather quickly with distance with a scaling of order 200 km. This
   illustrates large spatial heterogeneity in species composition, which
   should be accounted for in the design of schemes of such devices for
   assessing species diversity in these habitat-types.},

Abstract = {The effects of persistent organic pollutants on renal and liver
   morphology in farmed arctic fox ( Vulpes lagopus) were studied under
   experimental conditions. Control animals received a diet containing pork
   (Sus scrofa) fat with low amounts of persistent organic pollutants,
   while the diet of the exposed animals contained whale blubber,
   `naturally' contaminated with persistent organic pollutants.
   Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and organochlorine pesticide (OCP)
   concentrations in the whale blubber were 488 and 395 ng/g wet weight,
   respectively. Animals were sacrificed and sampled when they were at
   their fattest (winter) as well as their lowest body weight (summer). The
   results show that PCB and OCP exposure causes renal (and probably also
   liver) lesions in arctic foxes. The prevalence of glomerular, tubular
   and interstitial lesions was significantly highest in the exposed group
   (chi-square: all p < 0.05). The frequency of liver lesions (steatosis,
   intravascular granulocyte accumulations, interstitial cell
   infiltrations, lipid granulomas, portal fibrosis and bile duct
   hyperplasia) were also highest in the exposed group, although not
   significantly (chi-square: all p > 0.05). The prevalence of lesions was
   not significantly different between lean (winter) and fat (summer) foxes
   for any of the lesions (chi-square: all p > 0.05). We suggest that wild
   arctic foxes exposed to an environmental cocktail of persistent organic
   pollutants, such as PCBs and OCPs, in their natural diet are at risk for
   developing chronic kidney and liver damage. Whether such lesions may
   have an impact on age and health of the animals remains uncertain. (c)

Abstract = {Several studies have documented relationships between wave exposure and

   at a high level in the hierarchical habitat classification system EUNIS
   and is one of the Water Framework Directive water typology criteria of
   coastal waters. lsoeus (2004) has developed a continuous simplified wave
   model (SWM) that has been applied to several Nordic countries. Here we
   refine this model by introducing depth-attenuation, giving us the
   advantage of a model for wave exposure as it will actually work at the
   seabed. The values of the depth-attenuated model SWM(d) are
   approximately similar to the SWM model in shallow areas but noticeably
   lower in deep areas. The two models were compared in an analysis of the
   distribution of seabed substrate in the Stockholm archipelago. Using the
   depth-attenuated wave exposure instead of the SWM model as predictor in
   substrate modeling improved these models considerably.},

Abstract = {When reproduction competes with the amount of resources available for
   survival during an unpredictable nonbreeding season, individuals should
   adopt a risk-sensitive regulation of their reproductive allocation. We
   tested this hypothesis on female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), which
   face a trade-off between reproduction and acquisition of body reserves
   during spring and summer, with autumn body mass functioning as insurance
   against stochastic winter climatic severity. The study was conducted in
   a population consisting of two herds: one that received supplementary
   winter feeding for four years while the other utilized natural pastures.
   The females receiving additional forage allocated more to their calves.
   Experimental translocation of females between the herds was conducted to
   simulate two contrasting rapid alterations of winter conditions. When
   females receiving supplementary feeding were moved to natural pastures,
   they promptly reduced their reproductive allocation the following
   summer. However, when winter conditions were improved, females were
   reluctant to increase their reproductive allocation. This asymmetric
   response to improved vs. reduced winter conditions is consistent with a
   risk-averse adjustment in reproductive allocation. The ability of
   individuals to track their environment and the concordant risk-sensitive
   adjustment of reproductive allocation may render subarctic reindeer more
   resilient to climate change than previously supposed.},

Title = {Impact of abundance weighting on the response of seed traits to climate
   and land use},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {96},

Abstract = {1. Many studies have identified relationships between plant reproductive
   behaviour and environmental conditions. However, they have all been
   based on cross-species analysis and take no account of the relative
   abundance of species with vegetation.
   2. Using two reproductive traits - seed mass and dispersal vector - as
   examples, a range of previously identified relationships were tested
   using both unweighted and weighted-by-abundance data collected from
   land-use transitions at 12 sites across Europe.
   3. Seed mass was correlated positively with most measures of temperature
   (stronger relationships for unweighted data) and declined against
   measures of disturbance (stronger relationships with weighted data). It
   was not related consistently to measures of water availability.
   4. There was some evidence that endozoochory was associated with damper
   environments, hoarding with drier ones and exozoochory with more fertile
   habitats.
   5. Weighting reduced the slope of relationships between seed mass and
   environmental variables, possibly indicating that dominance within
   vegetation is determined by land use after the operation of a climatic
   filter. Fewer significant relationships were detected for weighted
   dispersal mechanisms compared to unweighted ones, indicating less
   difference of the dominants from other species with regard to this
   trait.
   6. Synthesis. This analysis shows that weighting by abundance in the

Abstract = {The paper presents empirical data on motivation for mountain biking in
   Norway In the study a mountain biker was defined as a person who had
   cycled on rough trails or in difficult terrain more than ten times
   during the previous year. The research sought to establish the degree to
   which the motivation for the `modern' activity of mountain biking
   differs from the motivation for more `traditional' outdoor recreational
   activities. In 2002 two surveys were conducted among bikers to take into
   account two different ways of practising mountain biking. A factor
   analysis was undertaken with 27 items from the Recreation Experience
   Preference (REP) scales to establish the relative importance of various
   kinds of motivation. Participants rated the importance of the factors on
   a scale from I (not at all important) to 5 (very important). `Physical
   exercise' scored a mean value of 4.46, `contemplation' 3.91 `nature \&
   place' 3.52, `speed \& excitement' 3.43, `managing challenges' 3.35,
   `social relations 2.49, and `equipment \& appreciation' 2.02. The paper
   concludes that a theoretical perspective which focuses on both change
   and stability in cultural development in the late-modern period is
   necessary for a nuanced understanding of the complexities of Norwegian
   outdoor recreation today.},

Abstract = {Research on impacts of human activity and infrastructure development on
   reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) is reviewed in the context of
   spatial (m to many km) and temporal (min to decades) scales. Before the
   1980s, most disturbance studies were behavioral studies of individual
   animals at local scales, reporting few and short-term (min to h) impacts
   within 0-2 km from human activity. Around the mid 1980s, focus shifted
   to regional-scale landscape studies, reporting that Rangifer reduced the
   use of areas within 5 km from infrastructure and human activity by
   50-95\% for weeks, months or even years and increased use of remaining
   undisturbed habitat far beyond those distances. The extent could vary
   with type of disturbance, sex, terrain, season, and sensitivity of
   herds. Of 85 studies reviewed, 83\% of the regional studies concluded
   that the impacts of human activity were significant, while only 13\% of
   the local studies did the same. Accurate assessment of impacts from
   human activity requires regional-scale studies, a pattern confirmed in a
   few long-term (decades) pre- and post-development studies. Such
   long-term studies are needed to improve understanding of both temporal
   and spatial patterns.},

Journal = {RURAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-133},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Due to strict protection through the last decades, wolves have returned
   to many areas from which they have been absent for a long time. This is
   a conservation success story, but the wolves also cause conflicts
   wherever they arrive. We have studied the situation in southeastern
   Norway and in the French Alps, where the conflict patterns are similar.
   Diverging interpretations of the situation are supported by narratives,
   and two varieties have become increasingly significant in both
   countries. Rumors about the secret reintroduction of wolves are common
   among wolf adversaries. Another narrative, important to the pro-wolf
   camp, is based on the notion that particular sheep husbandry practices
   (unattended rough grazing) are unique to either Norway or France-whereas
   there are in fact more similarities than differences. Yet, while the
   reintroduction-conspiracy rumors are ridiculed, the notion of unique
   national conflict patterns has achieved a status almost of official
   truth. Furthermore, the story about natural wolf recovery is itself a
   value-laden narrative, and not only ``scientific fact.{''} The different
   status of these narratives tell us something about power relations:
   Given their different social basis, it seems relevant to consider the
   national uniqueness image and the natural recovery theory as tightly
   inter-woven with symbolic power and the reintroduction conspiracy rumors
   as similarly inter-woven with patterns of cultural resistance.},

Abstract = {We analyzed lichen species composition and biomass in 815 plots on 163
   sites across wild reindeer regions in Norway, ranging from ranges with a
   long history of very low grazing pressure to heavily grazed sites.
   Reindeer density (1974-2000) and lichen biomass were well correlated for
   sites with comparable snow cover, altitude and terrain (R-2 = 0.81, P =
   0.006, n = 12). Absence of grazing for potentially several centuries has
   virtually resulted in a monoculture consisting of Cladina stellaris,
   Flavocetraria nivalis, and Alectoria ochroleuca (Syn. Bryocaulon
   ochroleuca). Light grazing in terms of 20 to 30\% removal of initial
   lichen cover easily eroded Cladina stellaris from exposed ridges by
   cratering and trampling by reindeer through the snow, while
   Flavocetraria nivalis persisted longer. This decline in lichen cover
   observed along a historic grazing gradient further resulted in
   increasing cover of bare ground, but less than expected from lichen
   removal due to gradual colonization of other species, such as mosses
   (incl. Polytrichum piliferum), crustose and fruticose lichens, dwarf
   shrubs (Arctostaphylos spp., Empetrum nigrum, Loiseleuria procumbens),
   and graminoids, particularly rushes (Juncus trifidus). Moderate grazing
   may thus increase plant diversity on ridges compared to ungrazed lands,
   and hence strongly influence gradients in biomass, composition and
   abundance of ridge communities across the landscape.},

Title = {When a generalist becomes a specialist: patterns of red fox predation on

Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The red fox (Vulpes vulpes (L., 1758)) functional response to roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus (L., 1758) fawn density was investigated in two
   Norwegian study areas characterized by a 26-fold difference in prey
   density and contrasting habitat characteristics. In the southern area,
   characterized by a fragmented agricultural landscape and high prey
   density, red fox consumption rates were closer to the specialist end in
   the specialist-generalist continuum of feeding habits. Conversely, in
   the northern area, dominated by boreal forest and with low prey density,
   the foxes displayed a type-III functional response typical of archetypal
   generalist predators. We suggest that differences in the predators'
   feeding habits reflect differences in prey profitability, which was much
   higher in the southern area owing to higher prey density and to the
   openness of the landscape that both favour the hunting of roe deer
   fawns. Different functional responses produced different predation rates
   (25\% for the southern area and 13\% for the northern area) and
   different temporal patterns (highest predation risk for fawns born at
   the beginning or at the end of the birth season). Even though the
   understanding of a predator's functional response is crucial for
   interpreting predation rates and patterns, much remains to be understood
   regarding its plasticity in different ecological settings. In the
   fawn-fox system, this might be the key factor in addressing unsolved
   questions regarding the adaptive value of reproductive synchrony as an
   antipredator strategy. Given the flexibility of the functional response
   and the resulting different impacts of predation with respect to birth
   synchrony, we suggest that reproductive synchrony evolved primarily in
   response to habitat seasonality and not as an antipredator strategy.
   Finally, our results contribute to the debate on the additive or
   compensatory nature of neonatal predation.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-83},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the light of the predicted changes in climate as a consequence of
   global warming, it is a major concern how animal species will respond to
   altered meteorological and oceanographic conditions. Seabirds constitute
   a diverse group of marine top predators which have relatively low
   fecundity and high annual survival rates. In order to predict effects of
   climate change, it is a necessary precondition to first understand
   responses to naturally occurring climatic fluctuations. While the
   ecological effects of different large-scale climatic phenomena have
   received much attention in the recent past, the factors determining the
   responses of seabirds are still little understood. We analyze more than
   a hundred previously published time series of seabird offspring
   production and adult survival rates in the North Atlantic in order to
   detect climatic signals in this data base. As our analyses are
   phylogenetic-comparative, we are able to search for patterns across
   species. Using the correlation of these parameters with the North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as a measure of responsiveness to climatic
   variability, we find that effects of climate on either parameters
   considered are not more common than expected by chance. The magnitudes
   of the responsivenesses were entirely randomly distributed throughout
   the seabird phylogeny, but were not strongly related to the explanatory
   variables considered. However, some tendencies indicate that both
   life-history traits and feeding ecology may influence how seabirds
   respond to climatic variability. An explanation of those patterns based
   on life-history theory is given.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and associations
   between OCs and fitness components were examined in great black-backed
   gulls (Larus marinus) in three colonies along the coast of northern
   Norway. In one of the colonies, data were collected in two subsequent
   seasons. Concentrations of four OCs (HCB, oxychlordane, DDE and PCB)
   were measured in blood (n=260) and fitness components (reproductive
   variables and adult return rate between breeding seasons) were recorded.
   In the first year, in two of the colonies, body condition and
   reproductive performance among the gulls were poor compared to the third
   colony, suggesting spatial variation in environmental conditions,
   especially food availability. However, in the third colony, body
   condition and reproductive performance were even better in the second
   season; i.e. environmental conditions varied temporally. OC residues
   were higher in the colonies where environmental conditions were poor,
   but much of this variation was explained by differences in body
   condition among colonies. Moreover, concurrent with improved body
   condition from one season to the next, the concentrations of OCs were
   halved. In the two colonies where environmental conditions were poor,
   female OC residues were negatively related to egg-laying date, egg size
   and nesting success, and in the colony where the concentrations of OC
   were highest, gulls with elevated DDE residues had low probability of
   returning between breeding seasons. In comparison, in the colony where
   environmental conditions were better in the first year, other types of
   adverse relationships between OCs and fitness components were found;
   i.e. chicks from females with high OC concentrations were in poor
   condition at hatching, suggesting maternal transfer of OCs to the eggs,
   and males with high OC residues had poor nesting success and chick
   survival, suggesting OC-mediated behavioural changes. With improved
   environmental conditions and lower OC concentrations in the second
   season, no significant adverse relationships between OCs and fitness
   components were found. This study thus suggests that there are complex
   interrelationships between both concentrations and ecological effects of
   OCs, and the environment, indicating that effects of OCs in nature may
   only be assessed after considering environmental variation. (C) 2007

Title = {Environmental value assessment in a multidisciplinary EIA setting},

Abstract = {Value assessment is a central element in an EIA for the understanding of
   the impacts of specified projects. The value assessment contains
   subjective elements and this may cause errors and difficulties in
   numeric value assessment methods. There is a need for transparent common
   criteria to promote discussion and understanding. A common criteria base
   already exists, but lack of communication between different management
   systems and different disciplines, all with different traditions in
   value assessment, makes the situation complex. In this article we have
   looked into the basic understanding of value linked to the investigation
   themes of natural environment, cultural heritage and society. The
   investigation themes linked to social science is difficult to
   incorporate into a common system, basically because they have less focus
   on land use and contain different value types.
   Much of the relevant literature about value assessment is linked to the
   assessment of sites of special interest as candidates for legal
   protection or conservation. In an EIA a much broader range of areas is
   introduced, including the ``every day landscape{''} with a lower and
   more general level of value. Together with a focus on mitigation and
   adjustments of plans, this results in a need for a more detailed value
   assessment scale than is normally in use today. We have suggested a new
   scale to ease communication between different disciplines and management
   systems.
   How we understand value is not constant over time, nor is the level of
   knowledge. This makes it necessary to sustain an ongoing debate on value
   assessment. The need for a dynamic value assessment system increases
   with the increasing use of database modelling, digital analysis of map
   data (GIS) etc. Lack of a ongoing value debate will rapidly lead to
   misleading and biased results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Optimal research and management of species with age structure often
   depends on estimates of age-specific population parameters, which in
   turn depends on reliable methods for age determination. By counting
   annuli in the cementum of incisor root tips from 51 known-age moose
   (Alces alces) between 1 and 12 years old, we examined the variation in
   accuracy and repeatability of age estimates provided by three research
   technicians with different experiences of aging moose. The most
   experienced technician estimated the moose age correctly in up to 90\%
   of the cases, while the technician with no prior experience estimated
   age correctly in up to 73\% of the cases. The medium-experienced
   technician achieved a lower accuracy (up to 53\%), indicating that
   experience alone is not sufficient if the basic training or lack of
   routine checks against other colleagues or a known-age material are not
   undertaken. The percentage moose aged within +/- 1 year from correct age
   was significantly higher in all technicians (94-98\%). After the
   generally high accuracy, we also found high repeatability (0.980-0.994)
   within technicians. We conclude that this method of age-determination
   provides reliable estimates that can be used by management and research
   to gain information about age-specific patterns in moose populations.
   However, to obtain estimates of high accuracy the technicians should be
   well trained, have gained the necessary experience, and most preferably,
   have access to a sample of teeth from known-age moose.},

Abstract = {1. Emergence traps were set overnight on the sediment surface to sample
   the littoral microcrustaceans of 22 Canadian Shield lakes that ranged in
   pH from 4.56 to 6.92. Traps were randomly allocated in quintuplicate in
   both wave-washed sandy habitats where pipewort (Eriocaulon septangulare)
   was the dominant macrophyte (termed pipewort habitats), and more
   protected habitats dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (termed
   floating-leaved habitats).
   2. In total, 50 cladoceran and 22 copepod species were found, with 16-45
   species in each lake. Lakes that had never acidified exhibited a more
   diverse fauna than lakes that had acidified.
   3. There were only minor differences between the numbers of species
   found in floating-leaved versus pipewort habitats except for one lake.
   Non-chydorid cladoceran, chydorids and copepods constituted 45\%, 26\%
   and 29\% of the total number of individuals, respectively.
   4. Based on presence/absence, dominance scores and frequency of
   occurrences of species, the microcrustacean faunal composition was
   similar in the two habitats. A detrended correspondence analysis
   confirmed that there was no separation between the two main types of
   habitat, and that pH was the parameter most strongly correlated with the
   dominant microcrustacean compositional gradient among lakes.},

Title = {Effects of pasture management on the natural regeneration of neotropical
   trees},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {371-380},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Natural regeneration of forest trees in grazed pastures could
   potentially contribute to the conservation of tree diversity within the
   fragmented and agricultural landscapes that dominate much of the
   tropics. To understand this potential, we evaluated the effects of
   several widely used pasture management practices on tree regeneration in
   pastures in a tropical dry forest (subhumid) region of central
   Nicaragua.
   2. Species richness, density, diversity and composition of seedlings,
   saplings and adult trees were compared in 46 pastures under different
   management conditions. The management conditions included three
   different types of grasses (Brachiaria spp., Cynodon spp. and
   naturalized pastures) and two categories of fire history (recently burnt
   and not recently burnt).
   3. Thirty-seven of the 85 tree species present in the pastures were
   regenerated under the current management conditions. The remaining 48
   species may have had reduced natural regeneration because of limitations
   in either germination, dispersal, establishment or growth, as well as
   because of negative effects of pasture management practices.
   4. The richness, density and species composition of tree seedlings
   within pastures were explained by grass species composition, the density
   and richness of adult trees, cattle management and the distance of the
   pasture to forest. In contrast, no clear effect of fire history was
   found.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Current management practices allow the
   regeneration of almost half of the tree species in grazed pastures.
   However, to enhance the regeneration of species that show limited
   regeneration, management strategies, such as the retention of adult
   trees, protection of saplings and seedlings from weeding and grazing and
   use of enrichment plantings, may be necessary. These changes in pasture
   management would help contribute to the long-term conservation of tree
   diversity within agricultural landscapes across the tropics.},

Abstract = {Eighty coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch smolts (40 wild and 40
   hatchery-reared) were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters
   and released into the Quinsam River over 2 days. Differences in
   physiology, travel time and migratory behaviour were examined between
   wild and hatchery-reared fish. In addition, tagged and control fish of
   both wild and hatchery-reared stock were raised for 3 months following
   surgery to compare survival and tag retention. Detection ranges of the
   acoustic receivers were tested in the river, estuary and ocean in a
   variety of flow conditions and tide levels. Receivers were placed in the
   river, estuary and up to 50 km north and south from the river mouth in
   the marine environment. Wild smolts were significantly smaller by mass,
   fork length and condition factor than hatchery-reared smolts and
   exhibited significantly higher levels of sodium, potassium and chloride
   in their blood plasma than hatchery-reared smolts. The gill Na+K+-ATPase
   activity was also significantly higher in the wild coho smolts at the
   time of release. Ninety-eight per cent of wild and 80\% of
   hatchery-reared fish survived to the estuary, 8 km downstream of the
   release site. No difference was found in migration speed, timing or
   survival between smolts released during daylight and those released
   after dark. Wild smolts, however, spent less time in the river and
   estuary, and as a result entered the ocean earlier than hatchery-reared
   smolts. Average marine swimming speeds for wild smolts were double those
   of their hatchery-reared counterparts. While hatchery smolts dispersed
   in both a northward and southward direction upon entering the marine
   environment, the majority of wild smolts travelled north from the
   Campbell River estuary. The wild coho salmon smolts were more
   physiologically fit and ready to enter sea water than the
   hatchery-reared smolts, and as a result had higher early survival rates
   and swimming speeds. (c) 2008 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2008

   developed in several countries. The ecological consequences of cod
   culture are poorly understood, but recent research suggests that
   Atlantic cod are more prone to escape from net pens than Atlantic
   salmon. Here, we describe the movements and the spatiotemporal
   distribution of farmed cod after escape relative to wild cod, both
   during and outside the natural spawning season. The experimental design
   included simulating escape incidents of farmed cod tagged with acoustic
   transmitters and using an array of automatic listening stations to
   monitor their dispersal and distribution. For comparison, local wild cod
   were monitored using the same array of receivers. The farmed cod
   dispersed rapidly after a simulated escape, they randomly distributed
   over large areas and their distribution overlapped with local wild cod.
   Moreover, escaped farmed fish were found at local cod spawning areas
   during the spawning season. The study also indicated that the recapture
   rate of escaped farmed cod was high compared with that of escaped farmed
   salmon. Thus, while our results showed that there is a considerable
   potential for ecosystem effects caused by escaped farmed cod, mitigating
   actions such as an efficient recapture fishery for escapees may be
   possible.},

Title = {Freshwater fishes, their biodiversity, habitats and fisheries in the
   Nordic countries},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {298-309},
Abstract = {Finland, Norway and Sweden have in total about 126500 lakes larger than
   four hectares. In Finland and Sweden, approximately 10\% of the surface
   area is freshwater; whereas in Norway, it is about 6\%. Altogether 56
   fish species are reproducing in the Nordic freshwaters, including four
   lamprey species. Due to geographical differences, the freshwater fish
   fauna differs considerably in the northern and southern parts; but
   species richness increases also from west to east. The proportion of
   recreational fishermen in Norway, Finland and Sweden was about 50\%,
   40\% and 27 \%, respectively, in 2004. Professional freshwater fishing
   is declining, but is still important in some lakes in Finland and
   Sweden. In all three countries, fishing rights belong to the water or
   land owner, with some exceptions.
   Water quality has improved in recent decades due to decreased nutrient
   loads from point sources, but the limitation of scattered nutrient loads
   has been less successful. This development can also be seen in the
   responses of fish communities. Some 30-40 years ago, waters close to
   many cities or industrial plants were heavily polluted and had only
   limited recreational or fisheries value. Recently, they are often
   inhabited by healthy fish populations. On the other hand, there are many
   highly eutrophic lakes in agricultural areas of southern and western
   Finland and Sweden that regularly suffer from algal blooms and high
   biomasses of cyprinid fish. The increasing acidification problem of
   oligotrophic lakes was related to long distance air pollution in recent
   years, but the situation has now improved. Lake regulation impacts the
   littoral ecosystems in hundreds of lakes and causes considerable
   negative impacts on feeding and reproduction areas for fish. The main
   measure used for compensating the damaged fish numbers has been
   stocking. Many large rivers have been modified for hydropower
   production. Most activities of fish habitat restoration are directed at
   rivers. Fisheries management includes several tools: regulations on use
   and structure of fishing gear, temporal and regional fishing
   restrictions, the size limits of target fish, the limitations of fishing
   efficiency, and amount of catch. The general goal is to meet the
   principles of sustainable use of natural resources.},

Journal = {ECOSCIENCE},

Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-149},
Abstract = {Spruce planting (Picea abies) in coastal birch forests (Betula
   pubescens) of northern Norway could influence ground-nesting species
   such as willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and black grouse (Tetrao
   tetrix). Predator-specific predation rates on baited trackboards were
   therefore studied in 3 successional edge gradients: birch forest
   adjacent to (1) closed spruce plantations, (2) open spruce plantations,
   and (3) clearings. We also examined the influence of 2 types of
   landscape-level variables on predation rates: the distance from sampling
   location to the nearest roads and buildings and the land use composition
   within a l-km radius of the sample. Predation rates were dominated by 2
   generalist species: red fox (Vulpes vulpes) (19.2\%) and hooded crow
   (Corvus corone cornix) (7.5\%). Predation appears dependent on the
   successional stage of spruce plantations, with areas near clearings
   (63.5\%) and open spruce plantations (59.8\%) experiencing higher
   predation pressures than closed spruce plantations (45.3\%). However,
   predation rates were highly variable among landscape blocks. Neither
   landscape nor vegetation variables could explain this block-level
   variation. We discuss alternative mechanisms that could explain
   differences between landscape blocks, but further studies are needed to
   understand the spatial heterogeneity of predators at larger scales.},

Title = {Understanding traditionalist opposition to modernization: Narrative
   production in a Norwegian mountain conflict},
Journal = {GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES B-HUMAN GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {90B},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-62},
Abstract = {In Gausdal, a mountainous community in southern Norway, a conflict
   involving dogsledding has dominated local politics during the past two
   decades. In order to understand local protests against this activity, in
   this article we apply discourse analysis within the evolving approach of
   political ecology. In this way, we also aim at contributing to the
   emerging trend of bringing political ecology ``home{''}. To many people,
   dogsledding appears as an environmentally friendly outdoor recreation
   activity as well as a type of adventure tourism that may provide new
   income opportunities to marginal agricultural communities. Hence, at a
   first glance, the protests against this activity may be puzzling.
   Looking for explanations for these protests, this empirical study
   demonstrates how the opposition to dogsledding may be understood as
   grounded in four elements of a narrative: (1) environmental values are
   threatened; (2) traditional economic activities are threatened; (3)
   outsiders take over the mountain; and (4) local people are powerless.
   Furthermore, we argue that the narrative is part of what we see as a
   broader Norwegian ``rural traditionalist discourse{''}. This discourse
   is related to a continued marginalization of rural communities caused by
   increasing pressure on agriculture to improve its efficiency as well as
   an ``environmentalization{''} of rural affairs. Thus, the empirical
   study shows how opposition to dogsledding in a local community is
   articulated as a narrative that fits into a more general pattern of
   opposition to rural modernization in Norway as well as internationally.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Global climate change is expected to shift species ranges polewards,
   with a risk of range contractions and population declines of especially
   high-Arctic species. We built species distribution models for
   Svalbard-nesting pink-footed geese to relate their occurrence to
   environmental and climatic variables, and used the models to predict
   their distribution under a warmer climate scenario. The most
   parsimonious model included mean May temperature, the number of
   frost-free months and the proportion of moist and wet moss-dominated
   vegetation in the area. The two climate variables are indicators for
   whether geese can physiologically fulfil the breeding cycle or not and
   the moss vegetation is an indicator of suitable feeding conditions.
   Projections of the distribution to warmer climate scenarios propose a
   large north- and eastward expansion of the potential breeding range on
   Svalbard even at modest temperature increases (1 and 2 degrees C
   increase in summer temperature, respectively). Contrary to recent
   suggestions regarding future distributions of Arctic wildlife, we
   predict that warming may lead to a further growth in population size of,
   at least some, Arctic breeding geese.},

Title = {Water quality limits for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) exposed to
   short term reductions in pH and increased aluminum simulating episodes},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {491-507},
Abstract = {Acidification has caused the loss or reduction of numerous Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations on both sides of the North Atlantic.
   Acid deposition peaked in the 1980's and resulted in both chronically
   and episodically acidified rivers. At present, water quality is
   improving in all affected rivers due to reduced acid deposition.
   However, spring snow melt, heavy rainfall and sea salt episodes can
   still cause short term drops in pH and elevated concentrations of
   bioavailable aluminum. Technical malfunction in lime dozers will cause
   short termed episodic spates in the limed rivers. The current situation
   has prompted a need for dose-response relationships based on short term
   exposures of Atlantic salmon to assess the potential population effects
   of episodic acidification. Water quality guidelines for salmon have been
   lacking, despite a large number of experiments, all demonstrating
   dose-response relationships between water chemistry and fish health. We
   have summarized results from 347 short-term (< 14 days) exposures of
   salmon parr and smolt performed between 1990 and 2003 in Norway. The
   experiments have been performed as bioassays, where fish have been
   exposed in tanks fed river water, in tanks where the river water quality
   has been manipulated (added H+ and Al) and as Carlin-tagged smolt
   releases after pre-exposure to moderately acidic waters. The results
   from the various bioassays are compared to water quality limits proposed
   on basis of the relationship between water quality and population
   status/health in Norwegian rivers. The focus of this article is placed
   on chemical-biological interactions that can be drawn across experiments
   and exposure protocols. We propose dose-response relationships for acid
   neutralizing capacity (ANC), pH, cationic Al and gill accumulated Al,
   versus mortality in freshwater, effects on hypo-osmoregulatory capacity
   in seawater challenge tests and on smolt to adult survival in release
   experiments. The ``no effect{''} dose depends on the life history stage
   tested and on the sensitivity of the biomarkers. Parr are more tolerant
   than smolt. Concentrations of Al that have no significant impact on
   freshwater life history stages can still have major population effects
   if they occur prior to smolt migration. While smolt can survive in
   freshwater for a prolonged period of time (> 10 days) at an Al dose
   resulting in a gill Al concentration of up to 300 mu g Alg(-1) dw, a 3
   day exposure resulting in a gill Al accumulation in the range of 25 to
   60 mu g Alg(-1) dw reduces smolt to adult survival in a dose related
   manner by 20 to 50\%. For smolt to adult survival, the biological
   significant response is delayed relative to the dose and occurs first
   after the fish enters the marine environment. In addition to exposure
   intensity and timing, exposure duration is important for the setting of
   critical limits.},

Abstract = {Community-based management of protected areas has become a strong

   this challenge, albeit with mixed results. Tanzania which is known for
   its abundant populations of wildlife in national parks has also
   developed several. projects and institutions to improve people-park

   National. Park in Tanzania. We address the basic questions of what is
   the extent of contact between park staff and the communities, what
   benefits are provided, and what needs do the communities see? There is
   little interaction between the park and adjacent communities, and white
   support is given to community projects, minimal benefits are distributed
   to the household or individual level. The current situation seems
   incapable of facilitating improved people-park relationships. (C) 2008

Title = {Nest distribution shaping within-stream variation in Atlantic salmon
   juvenile abundance and competition over small spatial scales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-172},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Spatial heterogeneity in population density is predicted to have
   important effects on population characteristics, such as competition
   intensity and carrying capacity. Patchy breeding distributions will tend
   to increase spatial heterogeneity in population density, whereas
   dispersal from breeding patches will tend to decrease it. The potential
   for dispersal to homogenize densities is likely to differ both among
   organisms (e.g. plants vs. mobile animals) and throughout ontogeny (e.g.
   larvae vs. adults). However, for mobile organisms, experimental studies
   of the importance of breeding distributions from the wild are largely
   lacking.
   2. In the present study, experimental manipulations replicated over
   eight natural streams and 2 years enabled us to test for effects of the
   distribution of Atlantic salmon eggs over spatial scales which are
   relevant to local interactions among individuals. Artificial nests were
   placed along 250 m study reaches at one of two levels of nest dispersion
   - patchy (two nests per stream) and dispersed (10 nests per stream) -
   while holding total egg density (eggs m(-2) stream area) constant.
   3. Nest dispersion had significant effects on the spatial distribution
   of the resulting juveniles in their first summer. Patchy nest
   distributions resulted in a highly right-skewed frequency distribution
   of local under-yearling densities (among 25 m sampling sections), as
   sample sections adjacent to the nest sites had relatively high
   densities. In contrast, dispersed nest distributions yielded
   approximately normal density distributions. Sections with high relative
   densities in the patchy nest distribution treatments also had relatively
   small juvenile body sizes, and patchy egg distribution appeared to
   produce a higher redistribution of individuals from the first to the
   second juvenile growth season than the dispersed distribution.
   4. Because patchy breeding distribution combined with limited early
   dispersal can create spatial variation in density over scales directly
   relevant for individual interactions, this will be one important
   component in determining mean levels of early juvenile competition and
   its spatial variation within populations. Assuming random or ideal-free
   distribution of individuals may therefore underestimate the mean level
   of density experienced by juveniles over surprisingly small spatial
   scales (orders of magnitude smaller than total spatial extent of
   populations), even for mobile organisms.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Pages = {664-680},
Abstract = {Rural tourism, especially through second-home development is increasing
   rapidly in much of Europe, the USA and Canada offering new economic
   opportunities for local communities, but also challenges related to
   environmental impacts and differing perceptions within communities about
   appropriate development paths. This study examines associations between
   the environmental attitudes of residents and attitudes towards
   second-home development in two regions in Southern Norway, with
   community attachment and economic dependency as additional predictors.
   Ecocentrism was found to have a strong negative effect on attitudes
   towards tourism development, while, in contrast to previous findings,
   community attachment did not have significant effects. Economic
   dependency is significantly related to attitudes towards development;
   both ecocentrism and economic dependency are mediated by other
   variables, such as expected impacts and benefits. The findings are
   important in planning to reduce potential conflicts.},

Title = {The effects of breeder loss on wolves},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-98},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Managers of recovering wolf (Canis lupus) populations require knowledge
   regarding the potential impacts caused by the loss of territorial,
   breeding wolves when devising plans that aim to balance population goals
   with human concerns. Although ecologists have studied wolves
   extensively, we lack an understanding of this phenomenon as published
   records are sparse. Therefore, we pooled data (n = 134 cases) on 148
   territorial breeding wolves (75 M and 73 F) from our research and
   published accounts to assess the impacts of breeder loss on wolf pup
   survival, reproduction, and territorial social groups. In 58 of 71 cases
   (84\%), >= 1 pup survived, and the number or sex of remaining breeders
   (including multiple breeders) did not influence pup survival. Pups
   survived more frequently in groups of >6 wolves (90\%) compared with
   smaller groups (68\%). Auxiliary nonbreeders benefited pup survival,
   with pups surviving in 92\% of cases where auxiliaries were present and
   64\% where they were absent. Logistic regression analysis indicated that
   the number of adult-sized wolves remaining after breeder loss, along
   with pup age, had the greatest influence on pup survival. Territorial
   wolves reproduced the following season in 47\% of cases, and a greater
   proportion reproduced where one breeder had to be replaced (56\%) versus
   cases where both breeders had to be replaced (9\%). Group size was
   greater for wolves that reproduced the following season compared with
   those that did not reproduce. Large recolonizing (>75 wolves) and
   saturated wolf populations had similar times to breeder replacement and
   next reproduction, which was about half that for small recolonizing (<=
   75 wolves) populations. We found inverse relationships between
   recolonizing population size and time to breeder replacement (r = -0.37)
   and time to next reproduction (r = -0.36). Time to breeder replacement
   correlated strongly with time to next reproduction (r = 0.97). Wolf
   social groups dissolved and abandoned their territories subsequent to
   breeder loss in 38\% of cases. Where groups dissolved, wolves
   reestablished territories in 53\% of cases, and neighboring wolves
   usurped territories in an additional 21\% of cases. Fewer groups
   dissolved where breeders remained (26\%) versus cases where breeders
   were absent (85\%). Group size after breeder loss was smaller where
   groups dissolved versus cases where groups did not dissolve. To minimize
   negative impacts, we recommend that managers of recolonizing wolf
   populations limit lethal control to solitary individuals or territorial
   pairs where possible, because selective removal of pack members can be
   difficult. When reproductive packs are to be managed, we recommend that
   managers only remove wolves from reproductive packs when pups are >= 6
   months old and packs contain >= 6 members (including >= 3 ad-sized
   wolves). Ideally, such packs should be close to neighboring packs and
   occur within larger ( >= 75 wolves) recolonizing populations.},

Abstract = {The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) causes large loss of free-ranging domestic
   sheep in Norway. We tested whether the observed higher kill rates by
   male lynx than female lynx were related to an association between the
   availability of the main natural prey, as measured by roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) habitat suitability, presence of sheep, and
   habitat selection of male and female lynx. We found that lynx selected
   areas with high roe deer suitability during summer and winter. Moreover,
   during summer, compared to male lynx, females had greater selection for
   roe deer areas and a stronger avoidance for sheep grazing areas, which
   suggests that previously observed differences in kill rates between male
   and female lynx can be attributed to sex-specific habitat use during
   summer. The connection between lynx habitat use and roe deer also was
   reflected in a positive relationship between the roe deer suitability of
   a sheep grazing area and the total loss of lambs, which suggests that
   livestock, rather than being actively selected, are mainly killed by
   lynx incidentally when encountered during other lynx activities (e.g.,
   searching for natural prey species). Therefore, any management practice
   that separates lynx and sheep, such as concentrating livestock into
   small patches or less preferred habitats, may reduce depredation.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-125},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework has
   evolved as an interdisciplinary tool to provide and communicate
   knowledge on the state and causal factors regarding environmental
   issues. Based on a social constructivist and discourse analytic
   perspective. this paper provides a critical examination of theoretical
   foundations of the DPSIR approach. We focus on the example of
   biodiversity, but our conclusions are relevant to other fields of
   environmental research. The DPSIR framework is viewed through the
   `lenses' of four major types of discourses on biodiversity:
   Preservationist, Win-win, Traditionalist and Promethean. Based upon this
   examination. we argue that the DPSIR framework is not a tool generating
   neutral knowledge. Instead, application of this framework reproduces the
   discursive positions the applicant brings into it. We find that when
   applied in its traditional form to studies in the field of biodiversity,
   the framework is most compatible with the Preservationist discourse type
   and tends to favour conservationist and to neglect other positions.
   Thus, contrary to what is often claimed, we find that the DPSIR
   framework has shortcomings as a tool for establishing good communication
   between researchers, on the one hand, and stakeholders and policy makers
   on the other. The problem with the framework is the lack, so far, of
   efforts to find a satisfactory way of dealing with the multiple
   attitudes and definitions of issues by stakeholders and the general
   public. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Large annual escapees of farmed Atlantic salmon enhance the risk of
   extinction of wild populations through genetic and ecological
   interactions. Recently, we documented evolutionary change in gene
   transcription between farmed and wild Atlantic salmon after only five
   generations of artificial selection. While differences for most
   quantitative traits are expected to gradually dilute through repeated
   backcrossing to wild populations, the genetic basis of gene
   transcription has been shown to be largely nonadditive and hybrid
   crosses may display unexpected inheritance patterns. This makes it
   difficult to predict to what extent interbreeding between farmed and
   wild individuals will change the genetic makeup of wild salmon
   populations. Here, we compare the genome-wide gene transcription
   profiles of Norwegian wild salmon to that of a second generation hybrid
   cross {[}backcross: (Farmed X Wild) X Wild]. Over 6\% (298, q-value <
   0.01) of the detected genes exhibited highly significantly different
   transcription levels, and the range and average magnitude of those
   differences was strikingly higher than previously described between pure
   farmed and wild strains. Most differences appear to result from
   nonadditive gene interactions. These results suggest that interbreeding
   of fugitive farmed salmon and wild individuals could substantially
   modify the genetic control of gene transcription in natural populations
   exposed to high migration from fish farms, resulting in potentially
   detrimental effects on the survival of these populations. This further
   supports the idea that measures to considerably reduce the number of
   escaped farmed salmon and their reproduction in the wild are urgently
   needed.},

Title = {Dispersal, demography and spatial population models for conservation and
   control management},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {153-170},
Abstract = {Spatial population dynamics can seldom be ignored in management aimed at
   conserving or controlling plant species in a spatial context. Therefore,
   spatial population models, that bring together knowledge about a
   species' local demography and dispersal behavior, are of growing applied
   importance. Here, we survey increasingly complex analytical and
   simulation models that are being developed to describe both demography
   and dispersal in applied studies. Local population dynamics can be
   modeled in an unstructured way, by specifying age- or stage-structure or
   by modeling each individual. Dispersal is often summarized in
   population-spread models with descriptive and simple statistical models.
   Mechanistic models that incorporate the physical or behavioral dynamics
   of dispersal vectors, however, provide more insight and can more readily
   be applied to novel situations. Importantly, mechanistic models provide
   a tool for linking variation in species traits and environments to
   dispersal and population spread.
   Spatial population models span a wide range: from diffusion models,
   metapopulation models, integrodifference equation models, and
   Neubert-Caswell models, to spatially explicit individual-based models.
   The complexity (and biological realism) of such models often trades off
   with tractability: for instance, individual-based simulation models
   allow for unlimited incorporation of biological detail, but rarely for
   analytical exploration of the model dynamics. We discuss the advantages
   and disadvantages of these various spatial population models; the choice
   of the most appropriate model will depend on the management objective,
   the biological complexity, available data and the principle of
   parsimony. We present five case studies of endangered and invasive
   species for which spatial population models have been developed to
   inform management, for instance to decrease the spread rate of invasive
   species or to improve the regional persistence of endangered species. We
   also anticipate exciting new developments in both spatial analytical and
   spatial simulation models with increasing demographic, dispersal and
   spatial sophistication. (c) 2007 R bel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published

Volume = {23},

Pages = {236-243},
Abstract = {In this study, 236 regeneration areas (mostly clear-cuts) in southern
   Norway were selected by random stratified selection: 118 of the study
   units were cut before and 118 after the introduction of forest
   certification in 1998. The degree of compliance with biodiversity
   measures established in the prevailing certification standard (ISO 14001
   and the Norwegian standard ``Living Forests'') was compared in a field
   study, and the differences were analysed. In some aspects, a clear
   difference could be seen, most clearly in an increasing number of green
   retention trees and an increasing mean width of buffer-strips left along
   rivers, bogs and lakes in the postcertification units compared with the
   precertification units. Even though there was a significant increase in
   the mean number of retention trees, as much as 21\% of the
   postcertification regeneration areas still did not have sufficient
   retention trees to comply with the certification standard and 41\% had
   either too few retention trees or too few spruce trees according to the
   standard. Concerning the management of small swamp forests, and the
   damage done to terrain and prelogging coarse dead wood by off-road
   transport, little improvement was seen. The discussion examines whether
   it is probable that the changes seen are a result of forest
   certification in Norway.},

Abstract = {Studies of public attitudes toward wolves tend to be descriptive in
   nature, and few sophisticated analyses of complex attitude patterns have
   been conducted. Drawing on findings from qualitative studies, the
   present study analyzed nationally representative survey data from Norway
   in order to probe the relationships between attitudes toward wolves and
   such factors as education, urban/rural place of residence, cultural
   capital, and various value orientations: environmental orientation,
   general political values, and trust in formal or informal information
   sources. Structural equation modeling confirmed that attitudes are
   embedded in more general cultural patterns. Although the cultural level
   is influenced by structural factors, effects of the background variables
   were reduced or disappeared in a model that included value orientations.
   This finding demonstrates that in order to access the level of meaning
   by means of survey methods, carefully constructed instruments and causal
   models must be employed.},

Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-79},
Abstract = {We report on 3 cases of mixed-aged litters (young born in different
   years) in brown bears (Ursus arctos); in I instance the cub-of-the-year
   (hereafter called cubs) died in the den. Two cases occurred in Sweden
   after mothers were separated from their young during the breeding
   season. In one, the mother was separated from the accompanying cub for
   at least 12.5 hours and possibly up to 3.3 days, and later possibly
   separated for 4 days. In the other, the mother was separated from her
   yearling at least 3 times for 1-14, 1-6 and 1-6 days. She was with a
   male during the first separation. Specific events that produced the
   mixed-aged litter observed in Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem were unknown
   and our interpretation is based on estimates of ages of accompanying
   young - from photographs. The observation of only 2 mixed-aged litters,
   after den emergence, from a sample of 406 observed cub litters
   accompanying radiomarked females confirms the rarity of this phenomenon.
   The mechanism apparently includes a short separation of mother and
   young, and, in the case of cubs, the mother must mate while lactating.
   Better understanding of the physiological mechanisms that allow
   mixed-age litters would help us in the debate about the occurrence of
   sexually selected infanticide in bears.},

Abstract = {The present study was undertaken to investigate endocrine and
   osmoregulatory changes during the parr-smolt transformation of
   anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). One year old, first
   generation hatchery-reared offspring of wild anadromous Arctic charr
   were kept at natural temperatures and a short daylength (10 h) during
   winter and continuous light from March until the end of the experiment
   in late June. At regular intervals, fish were sampled in freshwater for
   measuring gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the plasma levels of hormones
   known to be involved in smoltification, whereas other fish were exposed
   to 24-h seawater challenge tests for investigation of their
   hypoosmoregulatory ability. From mid-May onwards, there was an abrupt,
   and strong improvement in the fish's hypoosmoregulatory ability,
   concomitant with an increase in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The
   development of hypoosmoregulatory ability was preceded by increased
   growth hormone (GH) levels from March to April, a continuous increase in
   insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels from March to mid-June, and
   a transient increase in cortisol levels in parallel with the increase in
   gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity. These results support the roles of these
   hormones in stimulating the ion secreting machinery of the gills, and
   are in line with those considered typical for parr-smolt transforming
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A strong decrease in plasma thyroxine
   (T-4) levels during the last part of the smoltification period deviates
   from the often reported increase in this parameter in parr-smolt
   transforming Atlantic salmon and supports the view that this hormone has
   a permissive or supportive role only in teleost salinity adaptation. To
   conclude, the parr-smolt transformation of the anadromous Arctic charr
   strain used in the present study resembles that of Atlantic salmon, both
   with regard to the development of hypoosmoregulatory ability and
   regulatory (endocrine) mechanisms. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The timing of smoltification appears to be important for survival and
   homing in Atlantic salmon. For smolt produced as part of population
   enhancement strategies, it is important to produce smolts that smoltify
   at the same time as the wild smolts in the area. Further, both
   transportation and releasing methods induce stress in smolts which can
   affect migratory behaviour. Therefore, strategies to reduce stress will
   improve smolt survival. In the present three-year study (2001, 2002 and
   2003), smolt production experiments were carried out at a hatchery
   located in the northern part of Norway (70 degrees N). Prior to release
   1 kin above a permanent fish trap in the nearby River Halselva, smolts
   were tested according to standardized seawater challenge tests. Pairs of
   groups of individually Carlin tagged smolts were either released
   directly into the river, or given a 7-day recovery in net pens before
   they were released. The release experiments were performed during the
   two last weeks of June to the first week of July. Seawater tolerance in
   the beginning of July was better than 2 weeks earlier, and smolts
   released in the beginning of July also descended the river sooner after
   release than did fish released 2 weeks earlier. There was no difference
   in the proportion that migrated among groups released at different
   times. In the recovery experiment, a significantly higher proportion of
   the fish given 1-week recovery migrated compared to fish released
   directly after transport, in two of the 3 years examined.
   Thus, the hatchery-reared fish showed the same pattern as wild smolts.
   If they were released before they were fully smoltified, they delayed
   their migratory onset in the river and migrated when ready. Further, our
   results suggest that a period of recovery after handling and transport
   and before release caused more fish to migrate. (C) 2007 Published by

Abstract = {Acidification is acknowledged as the cause for extinction or catch
   reductions in numerous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations in
   Norway. In freshwater, labile (cationic/inorganic) forms of Al (LAl)
   accumulate in fish gills, where high concentrations result in mortality
   due to respiratory and ionoregulatory dysfunction. At lower
   concentrations, Al may still have population effects by inhibiting gill
   Na+,K+-ATPase activity, thereby reducing hypoosmoregulatory capacity and
   marine survival. Over the years 1999 to 2003 we exposed groups of 1150
   to 1200 one-year old hatchery reared, Carlin tagged Atlantic salmon
   smolts of the Imsa strain (South-Western Norway) to moderately acidified

   (long term exposure) days. Fish exposed to Lake Imsa water (pH > 6.5 and
   < 5 mu g LAl L-1) acted as controls. Control fish had gill-Al
   concentrations in the range of 5 to 10 mu g Al g(-1) gill dry weight
   (dw), while Al-exposed fish had gill-Al concentrations exceeding 20 mu g
   At g(-1) gill dw prior to seawater release. The physiological responses
   measured as plasma Cl- and glucose were related to the LAl concentration
   in water and to the accumulation of Al onto the gills. Gill
   Na+,K+-ATPase activity was depressed in all groups having >25 mu g Al
   g(-1) gill dw. Following exposure, the smolts were released into River
   Imsa to monitor downstream migration and ocean return rates. Acid
   exposed smolts migrated out of the river together with controls. Adult
   return rates were reduced by 20 to 50\% in all Al-exposed groups
   relative to the control groups, although marine growth was unaffected.
   The results suggest that even moderately and/or episodically acidified
   rivers containing 5-15 mu g LAl L-1 can cause substantial reductions in
   returns of Atlantic salmon. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Salmon populations on the western coast of Norway may experience both
   moderately acidified rivers and salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis
   Kroyer) attacks. The present study addresses the question of interactive
   effects of acidification and salmon lice infestation on postsmolt
   survival. Three groups each of approximately 1500 one-year old Atlantic
   salmon smolts of the Imsa strain, South-Western Norway, were exposed to
   one of three suboptimal water qualities (high acid, moderate acid and
   episodic acid) and experienced acidic water (pH 5.6-5.9 and 7-45 mu g
   Ali/l) with different exposure duration (3 to 10 days). A fourth group
   exposed to pH> 6.6 and < 9 mu g Ali/l acted as control (reference
   group). After freshwater exposure, smolts (n = 150) from each group were
   moved into tanks containing brackish water (16 parts per thousand) and
   after 8 h they were given full strength seawater (33 parts per thousand)
   and given 1 day of recovery before being infected with salmon lice
   copepodids. Four non-infected groups (n = 100) from the same exposures
   acted as controls. Over a 42 day period, postsmolts were regularly
   inspected and sampled for mortality, lice density and physiological
   status in seawater. The lice per smolt density were highest in the
   episodic acid group, followed by the high acid, moderate acid and the
   reference groups. Mortality was low in the four non-infected control
   groups, and significantly elevated in the lice infected groups (high
   acid > moderate acid > episodic acid > reference). Plasma chloride
   levels were within the normal range in the non-infected groups, while
   fish in the infected high acid and moderate acid groups had elevated
   plasma chloride levels. High gill aluminium was seen in the three
   exposure groups in freshwater. Year to year variations in acidification
   pressure and salmon lice densities can singularly and in combination
   explain some of the year to year variations in postsmolt survival and
   hence the variations in Atlantic salmon year-class strength in Norwegian
   rivers. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Eggs (n = 139) from tawny owls (Strix aluco) were collected annually
   (1986-2004) in Central Norway and analyzed for organochlorines (OCs) and
   brominated flame retardants (BFRs). p,p'-DDE
   (2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene) and polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) were the dominating contaminants (mean/median = 2.7/1.7
   and 2.9/1.6,mu g/g, lipid weight {[}l.w.], respectively), comprising
   90\% of the contaminant burden. Other OCs (hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB],
   hexachlorocyclohexanes {[}HCHs], traps-nonachlor and oxychlordane)
   comprised less than 4\% of the contaminant burden. Concentrations of OCs
   dropped 74-96\% during the study period; p,p'-DDE, HCB, beta-HCH,
   oxychlordane, and PCBs decreased rapidly in the early (1986-1989) study
   period (23-34\% per year; mean = 27.4\%), but leveled off to less than
   7\% (mean = 3.6\%) in the late period (2001-2004). The decrease in
   p,p'-DDE concentrations leveled off in the early 1990s, possibly due to
   an early ban on the use of DDT. alpha-HCH showed the strongest decline
   (always > 20\% per year), while traps-nonachlor and gamma-HCH dropped at
   a constant rate of 9\% per year. Toxaphene made up less than 0.6\% of
   the measured contaminants (mean/median = 39/13 ng/ g, l.w.), and the
   concentrations of these compounds were lower in the late period compared
   to the early period, but not significant. BFRs, including
   hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (Sigma
   PBDE: mean/median = 182/ 85 ng/g, l.w.) made up about 3\% of the
   measured contaminants. Sigma PBDE declined significantly over the study
   period (62\%). Most PBDE congeners declined: significantly for BDE-47
   (80\% reduction) and BDE-153 (50\% reduction), but the patterns
   differed; i.e., congeners associated with PentaBDE mixtures showed a
   rapid annual decline early (22-26\%) and a slower decline late in the
   study period (6-12\%), while the PBDEs associated with OctaBDE declined
   at a constant rate (1-4\%). This may result from a larger reduction in
   the use of PentaBDE compared to other PBDE products in Europe.},

Abstract = {The non-indigenous signal crayfish Pasifastacus leniusculus was

   represents an isolated pond about 100 km in air line from the nearest

   without any connecting watercourses. The occurrence is therefore
   undoubtedly caused by human introduction. Molecular analyses confirmed
   that tested individuals from the signal crayfish population were
   carriers of the crayfish plague agent Aphanomyces astaci. Disease
   carrying signal crayfish represents a severe threat to the indigenous
   and endangered noble crayfish Astacus astacus. Norwegian authorities are
   currently considering actions for the eradication of the signal crayfish
   population.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the morphological and genetic
   differentiation of lowland and montane populations of the Pieris napi
   species complex in Norway and to make inferences about the subspecific
   status of Pieris napi adalwinda and Pieris napi napi. We measured 22
   morphological characters on 228 individuals from eight populations in
   Central Norway (20-1100 m a.s.l.). In addition, lowland and mountain
   animals were reared at a high altitude locality. Half the animals from
   either locality were reared on mountain plant, and the other half on a
   lowland plant. Finally, a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
   gene was sequenced for individuals from Central and South-eastern Norway
   and Germany. Principal component analysis of morphological characters
   showed a zone of abrupt change from lowland to mountain morphological
   character states between populations at 506 m and 730 m a.s.l.,
   respectively. The transplant experiment showed that the morphological
   differences have a genetic basis and that food plants have no impact on
   morphology. Limited, but significant, molecular genetic differentiation
   was found between lowland and mountain animals, but the phylogenetic
   analysis, however, showed that the lowland form (P. n. napi) is
   paraphyletic and the montane form (P. n. adalwinda) is monophyletic.
   Further study is required before taxonomic recognition can be applied.

Number = {6},
Pages = {749-758},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {What are the relative contribution of temperature and solar irradiance
   as types of energy deliveries for species richness at the ecosystem
   level? In order to reveal this question in lake ecosystems, we assessed
   zooplankton species richness in 1891 Norwegian lakes covering a wide
   range in latitude, altitude, and lake area. Geographical variables could
   largely be replaced by temperature-related variables, e.g. annual
   monthly maximum temperature or growth season. Multivariate analysis
   (PCA) revealed that not only maximum monthly temperature, but also
   energy input in terms of solar radiation were closely associated with
   species richness. This was confirmed by stepwise, linear regression
   analysis in which lake area was also found to be significant. We tested
   the predictive power of the ``metabolic scaling laws{''} for species
   richness by regressing Ln of species richness over the inverse of the
   air temperature (in Kelvin), corrected for the activation energy (eV) as
   predicted by the Boltzmann constant. A significant, negative slope of
   0.78 for ln richness over temperature, given as 1/kT, was found, thus
   slightly higher than the range of slopes predicted from the scaling law
   (0.60-0.70).
   Temperature basically constrained the upper bound of species number, but
   it was only a modest predictor of actual richness. Both PCA-analysis and
   linear regression models left a large unexplained variance probably due
   to lake-specific properties such as catchment influence, lake
   productivity, food-web structure, immigration constraints or more
   stochastic effects.},

   important not only for interpreting serology results, but also for
   assessing transmission dynamics and the potential selective pressures
   acting on parasites. The aim of this paper was to investigate temporal
   variation in levels of specific Ab against the bacterium Borrelia
   burgdorferi sensu lato in adults of a long-lived colonial seabird, the
   Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla. In wild populations, adults are
   naturally exposed each breeding season to a Borrelia vector, the tick
   Ixodes uriae. Breeding birds were captured during four consecutive
   breeding seasons, and parasite infestation quantified. Using
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots, we found that
   the immunological profiles of anti-Borrelia Ab were highly repeatable
   among years, reflecting the interannual persistence of Ab levels. We
   nevertheless also observed that year-to-year changes of Ab levels were
   related to exposure to ticks in the previous year. The long-term
   persistence of Ab levels may be an important mechanism of individual
   protection against future exposure to the microparasite. It will also
   affect the availability of susceptible hosts, and thus the transmission
   dynamics of the bacterium. These results illustrate the need to consider
   the dynamics of the immune response in order to better understand the
   evolutionary ecology of host-parasite interactions in natural
   populations.},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {At present, there are 43 self-sustaining fish species in Norwegian fresh
   waters, 11 (26\%) of which are non-native, representing four families
   (Salmonidae, Cyprinidae, Centrarchidae and Ictaluridae). Human-mediated
   fish introductions probably began in the 15th century with common carp
   Cyprinus carpio, but most have occurred between the late 1800s and late
   1900s. The number of known established populations varies from one
   (goldfish Carassius auratus) to nearly 250 (tench Tinca tinea).
   Dispersal risk is also highest with tench, which is being spread by
   anglers for its appeal as a trophy fish. Intentional introductions to
   improve amenity angling have been part of fisheries management
   programmes (e.g. brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis), so this appears to
   be an increasingly common introduction vector despite the prohibition
   under legislation of introducing any species of non-native fishes. Some
   introduced species, such as brook trout, have declined in abundance and
   number of populations as the quality of acidified waters has been
   restored, being replaced by native brown trout Salmo trutta. Further
   range expansion by some species (e.g. common carp, goldfish and
   pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus is probably restricted by current climatic
   conditions. (c) 2007 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2007 Tire

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {The causes, effects and extent of minnow Phoxinus phoxinus introductions
   in Norway are reviewed to assess why the introductions have had severe
   effects, especially where brown trout Salmo trutta is the only fish
   species present. The natural distribution of minnow in Norway was mainly
   restricted to low altitude localities in the south-eastern part of the
   country and in some northern areas. The distribution area expanded
   considerably throughout the 1900s, especially in mountain areas, due in
   part to the use of minnows as live bait for angling. Although minnow
   densities do not seem unusually high in the relatively complex fish
   communities of its native range, the species can achieve very high
   population densities when introduced to communities with few fish
   species, such as in the numerous recently invaded lakes where brown
   trout was the only fish species present. The dense minnow populations in
   these lakes appear to have led to reduced recruitment and growth rates
   in the brown trout, with abundances on average 35\% lower in lakes where
   minnow has been introduced. The success of minnow in harsh habitats
   demonstrates their phenotypic and ecological plasticity, but also
   implies that their original distribution in Norway was restricted by
   early immigration history and not by environmental limitations. This
   suggests that human-assisted spread of the species could have strong
   adverse effects in Scandinavia lakes of low fish species richness. (c)

Abstract = {A synthesis of results from two projects was assessed to analyse
   possible influence of sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis on marine
   Atlantic salmon Salmo salar survival. During the years 1992-2004,
   trawling for wild migrating post-smolts was performed in
   Trondheimsfjord, a fjord in which no Atlantic salmon aquaculture
   activity is permitted. Prevalence and intensity of sea lice infections
   on migrating wild post-smolts differed between years. A correlation
   analysis between 1 sea-winter (SW) Atlantic salmon catch statistics from
   the River Orkla (a Trondheimsfjord river) and sea lice infections on the
   migrating smolts in the Trondheimsfjord was not significant. Up to 2\%
   reduction in adult returns due to sea-lice infection was expected. In
   addition, experimental releases from 1996 to 1998 with individually
   tagged groups of hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts given protection
   against sea-lice infection was performed. Higher recaptures of adult
   Atlantic salmon from 1998 treated smolts compared to the control group
   may correspond to high abundance of sea lice found on the wild smolt,
   and may indicate influence on post-smolt mortality. These studies
   indicate that post-smolt mortality in Trondheimsfjord is marginally
   influenced by sea lice infection; however, the methods for assessing
   wild smolt mortality might be insufficient. Higher infections of sea
   lice farther out in the fjord may indicate more loss in Atlantic salmon
   returns in some years.},

Abstract = {Seasonal and diel migration timing of wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
   smolts and adults were investigated annually (2001-2004) in the
   subarctic River Utsjoki, a tributary of the large River Teno (70 degrees
   N), using underwater video monitoring. Submerged video cameras provided
   information on the exact timing and intensity of both migrations in a
   natural river channel, without disturbing the fish. In contrast to the
   mainly nocturnal migration pattern described from temperate rivers, the
   River Utsjoki smolts and adults migrated throughout the day. Smolts
   migrated most intensively during hours of rising (0300-0900 hours) and
   high sun (0900-1500 hours), while adults favoured the period of low sun
   (2100-0300 hours). Smolt migrations started in June and lasted on
   average 42 days. Adults usually ascended the site 2-3 weeks before the
   first descending smolts were observed and the adult migrations extended
   to the end of August. Seasonal synchrony was observed between smolt and
   adult migrations in years of slowly warming water, whereas in a year of
   exceptionally warm early summer (2002), smolts migrated earlier than
   adults. Thus, water temperature seemed to be an important environmental
   factor triggering the smolt migration, while the migration of adults was
   probably more fixed to a certain season. Weak positive correlations
   between fish counts and water temperature were observed, indicating that
   increasing water temperature may have promoted both smolt and adult
   migrations. The influence of discharge was negligible, although
   increasing discharge late in the season may have activated the remaining
   individuals in both groups. (C) 2007 The Authors.},

Title = {Energetic costs of diving and prey-capture capabilities in cormorants
   and shags (Phalacrocoracidae) underline their unique adaptation to the
   aquatic environment},

Abstract = {Cormorants and shags are foot propelled pursuit divers that forage on
   benthic and pelagic fish. Previous studies suggested that diving in
   cormorants is extremely costly, and this is usually attributed to their
   partially wettable plumage and inefficient mode of propulsion. We
   investigated the energetic requirements of three Phalacrocorax species
   during diving. Our results indicate that, when the differences in
   experimental conditions and calculation methods are accounted for,
   energy expenditure during shallow horizontal diving in these species is
   similar and not considerably different from other avian divers. In the
   absence of direct measurements, thermodynamic modelling has been used to
   assess the impact of dive depth on the energetic costs of diving. Based
   on this, the energetic costs of Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo)
   diving during the winter in Greenland were estimated to be as high as 64
   W kg(-1) (similar to 21 x RMR). A recent study measured the effect of
   depth on the diving energetics of Double-crested Cormorants (P. auritus)
   to be much less drastic than suggested by this model. Extrapolating from
   the latter study to conditions encountered by birds wintering in
   Greenland shows that the thermodynamic model might greatly overestimate
   the energetic demand of Great Cormorants during diving. Using an
   improved model, the daily food intake of Great Cormorants wintering in
   Greenland was calculated to be similar to 1,170 g. Taking into account
   the recorded time that birds spend diving every day, such food intake
   would require the highest prey-capture rate suggested so far for an
   avian pursuit diver (similar to 41 g min(-1) underwater). However,
   little is known about the prey-capture capabilities of avian divers. We
   used an underwater video array to study the effect of prey density (live
   juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) on the prey-capture
   performance of Double-crested Cormorants. We found that cormorant
   capture success greatly depended on prey density. Prey capture rate was
   highest at the greatest fish densities and easily surmounted 41 g
   min(-1) underwater. This would suggest that cormorants in Greenland
   might be able to achieve these high capture rates, if prey densities are
   sufficiently high. However, what prey items are encountered by
   cormorants during the winter in Greenland and at what densities remains
   to be investigated.},

Abstract = {Monitoring of lynx Lynx lynx populations in Scandinavia is largely based
   around unreplicated minimum counts of family groups, i.e. adult females
   with dependent kittens. When observations cannot be separated from each
   other on the basis of back-tracking in the snow it is desirable to use a
   distance rule to separate observations of groups that are so far apart
   that they are unlikely to be derived from the same group. We have
   analysed radio-telemetry derived movement data from five study areas,
   corresponding to three ecologically different regions, in Scandinavia,
   and included data from Poland for comparison. We derive examples of two
   different distance rules; one is a static rule based on home-range size
   and length which is suitable for observations accumulated during a whole
   winter, and the other is a dynamic rule suitable for observations
   collected within 1-7 days of each other. Because of inter-study area
   variation in home-range size and movement there is a need to use
   different rules in different regions. Within Scandinavia, average
   maximum home-range lengths varied from 28 to 54 km, and average maximum
   daily distances travelled varied from eight to 16 km in the three
   regions. This implies that locally collected movement data are a
   prerequisite for application of this type of methodology.},

Abstract = {Counts of tracks that passively accumulate on a suitable substrate are
   commonly used to derive indices of large carnivore abundance. In this
   study we evaluate the suitability of a similar survey using multiple
   3-km long transect-lines to detect changes in population size for
   Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in central Norway. We used GIS methods to
   simulate the crossing of transect lines by lynx using real telemetry
   data from the study area. We compared the effect of transect-line
   placement (deliberate vs random), transect-line density, and the number
   of nights over which tracks can accumulate in the snow. For each
   scenario we evaluated both the probability of detecting lynx that are
   present in the survey area, and the power of the index to detect changes
   between consecutive surveys. Deliberately placed lines performed
   significantly better than randomly placed lines, and as expected,
   increases in line density and the period of track accumulation improved
   the outcome. Using three nights of track accumulation and the highest
   density of deliberately placed lines that we simulated (1/38 km(2))
   indicated that both the probability of detecting individual lynx present
   within the survey area, and the power to detect a 33\% change in
   population size between two surveys, were > 80\%.},

Title = {Selectivity of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and recreational hunters for age,

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {13},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Data on the age, sex and condition of roe deer Capreolus capreolus
   killed by Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and human hunters were collected in
   two study areas in the counties of Nord-Trondelag and Hedmark in central
   and southeastern Norway, respectively. Data on the age and sex structure
   of the standing population were also collected. No differences in the
   age or sex structure of roe deer killed by lynx were found between the
   two study areas or between years with differing snow depths which was
   expected to affect age-class vulnerability. The profile of 151
   lynx-killed roe deer (24\% adult males, 44\% adult females, 11\% male
   fawns and 21\% female fawns) was not statistically different from that
   of the standing population. In contrast, hunters killed a significantly
   larger proportion of adult animals, especially males (44\% adult males,
   28\% adult females, 15\% male fawns and 13\% female fawns). The detailed
   age structure of lynx killed and hunter killed animals was not different
   within the adult age class. The body condition of roe deer declined
   during late winter (more so for males than for females), however, there
   was no difference in the condition of roe deer killed by lynx or hunters
   during early winter (the hunting season ends on 24 December). The
   overall picture is typical of a stalking predator that has few options
   to select individuals based on condition, age or sex in a prey species
   with no sexual dimorphism and which is relatively small in relation to
   the size of the predator (lynx are 50-70\% the size of an adult roe
   deer). Human hunters, on the other hand, are clearly harvesting a
   non-random section of the population. The result is that hunting does
   not replicate natural predation, although lynx predation is likely to
   have a higher per capita impact on roe deer growth rates.},

Abstract = {1. Little is known about the maternal transfer of antibodies in natural
   host-parasite systems despite its possible evolutionary and ecological
   implications. In domestic animals, the maternal transfer of antibodies
   can enhance offspring survival via a temporary protection against
   parasites, but it can also interfere with the juvenile immune response
   to antigens.
   2. We tested the functional role of maternal antibodies in a natural
   population of a long-lived colonial seabird, the kittiwake (Rissa
   tridactyla), using a vaccine (Newcastle disease virus vaccine) to mimic
   parasite exposure combined with a cross-fostering design.
   3. We first investigated the role of prior maternal exposure on the
   interannual transmission of Ab to juveniles. We then tested the effect
   of these antibodies on the juvenile immune response to the same antigen.
   4. The results show that specific maternal antibodies were transferred
   to chicks 1 year after maternal exposure and that these antibodies were
   functional, i.e. they affected juvenile immunity. These results suggest
   that the role of maternal antibodies may depend on the timing and
   pattern of offspring exposure to parasites, along with the patterns of
   maternal exposure and the dynamics of her immune response.
   5. Overall, our approach underlines that although the transgenerational
   transfer of antibodies in natural populations is likely to have broad
   implications, the nature of these effects may vary dramatically among
   host-parasite systems, depending on the physiological mechanisms
   involved and the ecological context.},

Abstract = {Macro-ecological theories relating species richness, abundance, range
   size, biological traits and environmental tolerance have rarely been
   tested in marine soft-sediments, despite the spatial extent of these
   habitats and the inherent richness of resident communities. This study
   examines the contribution of rare species to marine soft-sediment
   communities from New Zealand, focussing on the relationships of range
   size with abundance, environment, habitat diversity and life history
   traits. 54\% of the 351 species sampled exhibited restricted ranges
   (found at <= 2 sites). In contrast to many terrestrial systems, we
   observed only a weak positive relationship between abundance and
   frequency of occurrence. Restricted-range species were not randomly
   distributed, with their distribution related to habitat characteristics,
   suggesting an important link between habitat diversity and rarity. They
   exhibited a similar range of traits to the total observed species pool,
   suggesting that they are not only important to biodiversity but could
   play a role in stability. Restricted range species were generally not
   small and this, together with the number of different biological traits
   represented, suggests that rare species are important to the functioning
   of marine systems. Thus, our results highlight the importance of
   considering rare species in habitat-based approaches to conservation.

Title = {Convergent evolution and paraphyly of the hawk-eagles of the genus

Abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships within the New and Old World hawk-eagle
   assemblage (genus Spizaetus; Aves: Accipitridae) were studied using
   mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome b, control region). Eighty-four
   specimens representing all Spizaetus species and almost all currently
   distinguished subspecies as well as 11 other booted and non-booted
   `eagle' genera from the Neotropics, Africa, Eurasia, South Asia and
   Australasia (Oroaetus, Harpia, Morphnus, Lophaetus, Stephanoaetus,
   Hieraaetus, Aquila, Ictinaetus, Spilornis, Pithecophaga, Harpyopsis)
   were investigated. Although the basal branching could not be resolved,
   our investigations clearly indicate that hawk-eagles represent a
   paraphyletic assemblage and thus their external similarities have to be
   ascribed to convergent evolution. The New World taxa of Spizaetus
   cluster together, but the South American species Oroaetus isidori
   appears embedded within this clade. The taxa from Southeast to East Asia
   form a clearly separated monophyletic group. It is further divided into
   two subgroups, which are also characterized by distinct juvenile plumage
   patterns. Spizaetus africanus, the only African representative of the
   genus, is found in a mixed cluster consisting of members of the genera
   Aquila and Hieraaetus. These findings are in accordance with previous
   studies of other authors based on various molecular markers and
   different sets of taxa, but disagree with current taxonomy. Therefore,
   we suggest assigning the species of the genus Spizaetus to three
   different genera: (1) Spizaetus (including Oroaetus isidori) in Central
   and South America and (2) Nisaetus for the Southeast to East Asian
   group. (3) The African taxon (Spizaetus africanus) is discussed to be
   included into the genus Aquila. Furthermore, we propose to use the
   former genus name Lophotriorchis Sharpe, 1874, for the monotypic species
   Hieraaetus kienerii, which has an isolated phylogenetic position.},

Abstract = {A general feature of the demography of large ungulates is that many
   demographic traits are dependent on female body mass at early ages.
   Thus, identifying the factors affecting body mass variation can give
   important mechanistic understanding of demographic processes. Here we
   relate individual variation in autumn and winter body mass of moose
   calves living at low density on an island in northern Norway to
   characteristics of their mother, and examine how these relationships are
   affected by annual variation in population density and climate. Body
   mass increased with increasing age of their mother, was lower for calves
   born late in the spring, decreased with litter size and was larger for
   males than for female calves. No residual effects of variation in
   density and climate were present after controlling for annual variation
   in mother age and calving date. The annual variation in adult female age
   structure and calving date explained a large part (71-75\%) of the
   temporal variation in calf body mass. These results support the
   hypotheses that (a) body mass of moose calves are affected by qualities
   associated with mother age (e.g. body condition, calving date); and (b)
   populations living at low densities are partly buffered against temporal
   fluctuations in the environment.},

Title = {The ecology and evolution of tooth wear in red deer and moose},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {116},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1805-1818},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Differences in body size and diet type (browser-grazer continuum) have
   formed functional traits of ruminants, including tooth design. Grazers
   and mixed-feeders eat a more fibrous diet than browsers, which arguably
   increase tooth wear. Tooth wear has also been suggested to increase with
   body size. Moreover, for species with large distribution ranges,
   different populations may be exposed to very different ecological
   factors affecting diet and thus tooth wear rates. Therefore,
   evolutionary history and contemporary ecological conditions, both
   operating through diet, may be important for patterns of tooth wear.
   Here, we compare inter- and intraspecific rates of tooth wear in
   multiple populations of one large browser (moose Alces alces) and one
   mixed-feeder (red deer Cervus elaphus) covering the main distribution
   range of each species in Norway. We found that the mixedfeeding red deer
   wore teeth faster than the larger and browsing moose, suggesting that
   feeding-type was more important than body size for patterns of wear.
   There was substantial spatial variation in tooth wear rates, but the
   inter-specific difference in wear was consistent. Molar wear rates, but
   not incisors wear rates, in the browser were less variable between
   populations than in the mixed-feeder. There was no close link between
   incisor and molar wear rates at the population level. Our findings are
   consistent with the view that both evolution related to diet type and
   current ecological conditions (being proxies for within-species
   variation in diet quality) are important for patterns of tooth wear.},

Abstract = {Extensive mortality in Atlantic salmon fry was reported in the River
   Aelva from 2002 to 2004. Dead fish were collected in late summer 2006,
   and live fish were sampled by electrofishing in September the same year.
   At autopsy and in histological sections, the fish kidneys were found to
   be pale and considerably enlarged. Proliferative lesions with
   characteristic PKX cells were seen in a majority of the fish. DNA from
   kidney samples of diseased fish was subjected to PCR and sequencing, and
   the amplified sequences matched those of Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae.
   We concluded that this myxozoan transmitted from bryozoans was the main
   cause of the observed mortality in salmon fry in 2006. Results from
   quantitative electrofishing in 2005 and 2006, combined with the observed
   fry mortality from 2002 to 2004, show that the smolt production in the
   river is severely reduced and that T bryosalmonae is the most likely
   explanation for this decline. The present study is the first to report a
   considerable negative population effect in wild Atlantic salmon due to
   proliferative kidney disease (PKD). It also represents the northernmost
   PKD outbreak in wild fish. The river is regulated for hydroelectric
   power purposes, causing reduced water flow and elevated summer
   temperatures, and the present PKD outbreak may serve as an example of
   increased disease vulnerability of northern fish populations in a warmer
   climate.},

Abstract = {This paper examines small-scale fish vending in a southern African
   floodplain from two perspectives: as a link between natural resource use
   and consumption, and as a livelihood in itself. We used a combination of
   observation, surveys and semistructured interviews in a market in Katima
   Mulilo, Namibia, to determine sources of fish, preferences and
   constraints to vending, average investment and profit, as well different
   routes into fish vending and perceptions regarding vending. Most vendors
   come from fishing households, but their stock is often an accumulation
   of purchases from other fishers. There is little evidence of formal
   arrangements between fishers and vendors, yet most adapt to the highly
   variable natural and social environments of the region. Although all
   vendors ranked selling fish as their most important livelihood activity,
   a wide range of investment and profit exists among individuals. Our
   findings indicate that fisheries management proposed for the area must
   be developed with a careful understanding of how changes in access and
   use will affect vending livelihoods.},

Abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in biological studies of spatial dynamics,
   but the initiation of dispersal has often been neglected, despite strong
   indications that differential timing of dispersal can significantly
   affect dispersal distances. To investigate which plant and environmental
   factors determine the release of plumed seeds by the invasive thistles
   Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans, we exposed 192 flower heads of
   each species to increasing wind speeds in a full-factorial wind tunnel
   experiment with four air flow turbulence, three flower head wetness and
   two flower head temperature levels. The number of seed releases was
   highest under dry and turbulent conditions and from heads that had
   already lost a considerable number of seeds, but was not affected by
   flower head size, head angle or temperature. Inspection of the trials on
   video showed that higher wind speeds were needed to meet the seed
   release threshold in laminar flows and for C. acanthoides heads that had
   been wet for a longer time. Species differences were minimal, although
   seed release was more sensitive to lower levels of turbulence in the
   larger-headed and more open C. nutans heads. Knowledge of seed release
   biases towards weather conditions favourable for long-distance dispersal
   improves our understanding of the spread of invaders and allows managers
   to increase the efficiency of their containment strategies by applying
   them at crucial times.},

Title = {Monitoring archaeological sites in a changing landscape - Using
   multitemporal satellite remote sensing as an `early warning' method for

Journal = {ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {In the coastal areas of North Norway farm abandonment followed by
   regrowth and reforestation is a major factor leading to landscape
   change. One consequence of this change is that archaeological sites are
   lost. A survey programme started by the Norwegian Directorate for
   Cultural Heritage in 1997, aimed at monitoring the condition of
   archaeological sites listed in the Norwegian National Sites and
   Monuments Record, has documented that regrowth processes represent a
   threat to the sites. The extent of the problem of regrowth and
   reforestation of archaeological sites is mostly unknown, however, and
   efficient coping strategies are not developed. In this article we
   present a change detection method based on the use of the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) applied to Landsat images with
   different acquisition dates, followed by image differencing. This
   procedure results in an easily interpretable and extremely quick
   approach to change detection of land cover as well as change in biomass,
   and it can be used as a `first warning' method to indicate
   archaeological sites threatened by regrowth processes. The method as it
   is applied in this study appears to be most suitable for monitoring
   changes in the infield areas where contrasts are clearest. Further
   development is possible, both at the regional level using medium
   resolution satellite remote sensing where the aim is to detect
   significant changes in the agricultural as well as the cultural
   landscape, and at the site level, where use of the same method on data
   from high-resolution sensors will allow monitoring of the site on a very
   detailed scale. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {The physiological consequences of ``premature migratory return{''} to
   freshwater for wild sea-run brown trout (Salmo trutta) smolts infested
   with sea lice (Lepeoplitheirus salmonis) were investigated in the
   laboratory. Osmoregulatory, metabolic, and stress markers were analysed
   in order to assess the potential consequences of transfer to freshwater,
   19 days after the challenge with L. salmonis. Infestation intensity was
   significantly reduced following transfer to freshwater, and mortality
   rates were markedly higher in infested fish maintained in seawater vs.
   fish that were transferred to freshwater. Significant sea lice effects,
   consistent across a number of physiological markers, were apparent once
   L. salmonis developed to the mobile stages. Plasma chloride, lactate,
   and cortisol all were significantly higher than control values, and
   liver glycogen concentration was significantly reduced in infested fish
   in seawater. After return to freshwater, these physiological measures
   returned to control levels, but significant lice effects persisted for
   fish maintained in seawater. Premature return of infested sea-run brown
   trout to freshwater does, therefore, confer significant short-term
   physiological benefits across a range of osmoregulatory, metabolic, and
   stress markers.},

Title = {Reproductive performance and organochlorine pollutants in an Antarctic

Abstract = {Despite low levels of organochlorine contaminants (OCs) in Antarctic
   biota, some compounds may exceed the levels in equivalent Arctic
   species, and previous studies have found biochemical evidence of
   pollutant exposure in south polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki), a
   common marine top predator in the region. In this study we examined
   relationships between fitness components (fecundity and adult return
   rate between breeding seasons) and concentrations of OCs in this
   species. In 65 nests, both males and females were caught, and using
   principal component analyses (PCA) we produced composite measurements
   (PC1 and PC2) of six highly correlated OCs measured in blood samples.
   Although the concentrations of OC were below those documented to have
   reproductive effects in other aquatic birds, we found that the eggs of
   females with high levels of OCs in the blood hatched later, and their
   chicks were in poorer condition at hatching, than females with low OC
   levels. Thus OCs may delay reproduction and reduce foetal growth in the
   skuas. However, there was no relationship between the parents' OC
   residues and the occurrence of non-viable eggs, although the proportion
   of nests containing non-viable eggs was high (47\%). Moreover, there
   were no significant relationships between OCs and reproductive variables
   in males, even if males had higher OC levels than females, and no
   associations between OCs and adult return rate between breeding seasons.

Abstract = {Radio transmitters were implanted in wild brown trout, Salmo trutta L.,
   in the River Mana at low summer water flows (n = 18), higher flow in
   summer (n = 20), and variable, peaking flows in autumn (n = 20), and
   tracked two to four times day and night for 4-5 weeks. Individuals were
   caught and released in a 4-km uniformly channelised section, and in a
   4-km natural diverse river section. Substantial individual variation in
   home range and total movement (924-85 818 m(2) and 295-7014 m) suggested
   flexibility to adapt to local environmental conditions. Fish were
   stationary most of the time (median movement 0 m), but some individuals
   undertook few and apparently sporadic longer movements, sometimes
   involving shifts in home range. No consistent diurnal pattern in
   movements was found. Trout in the uniform habitat section appeared to
   have larger home ranges and moved more than trout in the natural
   section. Differences were, however, not statistically significant in
   most comparisons, due to large individual variation. Similarly, larger
   home ranges and movements between trials related to higher flow were
   found, but differences were generally not significant. No consistent
   effects of sudden, extreme peaking flows on area use or movements by the
   brown trout were observed.},

Title = {Metabolic rate, behaviour and winter performance in juvenile Atlantic

Abstract = {Contrasting results of relations between standard metabolic rate,
   behaviour and performance suggest that the evolutionary trade-offs in
   energy allocation between metabolisms and other parts of the energy
   budget depend on environmental conditions. Here, we show how habitat
   complexity changes the relationship between standard metabolic rate,
   behaviour and performance (winter energy loss-rates) in juvenile
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).
   Juvenile Salmon, individually screened for standard metabolic rate, were
   stocked in replicated semi-natural stream channels with and without
   sheltering possibilities under ledge cover. We recorded the use of
   ledged areas, energy-loss rates and feeding activity during a 61-day
   period.
   In the channels with ledge cover, individuals with relatively higher
   standard metabolic rates used areas outside of the cover more frequently
   and had higher feeding frequency than individuals with lower standard
   metabolic rates. No relationship was apparent between areas used,
   feeding and standard metabolic rate for the individuals within the
   no-cover treatments. In channels without cover, there was a negative
   relationship between standard metabolic rate and performance (energy
   balance), whereas standard metabolic rate did not affect performance in
   channels with ledge cover.
   The effect of standard metabolic rate on performance depended on habitat
   complexity expressed through differences in behaviour. In channels with
   ledge cover, individuals with higher standard metabolic rates were
   apparently able to compensate for higher metabolic costs by utilizing a
   riskier habitat outside the cover and attaining a higher feeding
   success.
   The present study demonstrates that the relationship between standard
   metabolic rate and performance may be dependent on habitat complexity
   and vary on small spatial scales, contributing to the persistence of
   large variation in standard metabolic rate within populations.},

Abstract = {Ageing is associated with a decline in basal metabolic rate (BMR) in
   many species, including humans. The evolutionary and physiological
   causes underlying the relationship between age and BMR are poorly
   understood. Studies of procellariiform seabirds may provide valuable
   insight because they have a longer maximum lifespan than expected from
   their body size and rates of energy metabolism. Such studies are rare,
   however, because there are few populations with a high proportion of
   individuals of known age.
   We performed a cross-sectional study of energy metabolism in relation to
   age in a long-lived seabird, the snow petrel Pagodroma nivea. In an
   Antarctic population that has been subject to a long-term research
   program, including annual banding of chicks since 1963, we measured BMR
   of individuals aged between 8 and 39 years. We show that the BMR of the
   snow petrel does not decrease with increasing age. BMR seems to be
   sustained at a fixed level throughout the investigated age-span.
   We review this result in light of the disposable soma theory of ageing,
   and we discuss whether species-specific relationships between age and
   basal metabolic rate can be related to differences in maximum lifespan.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {943-956},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, effects of stock origin, fish size, water flow and
   temperature on time of river ascent of adult Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
   were tested. Brood stocks were collected in eight Norwegian rivers
   situated between 59 and 69 degrees N. The fish were reared to smolts,
   individually tagged and released in the River Imsa, south-west Norway
   (59 degrees N). Adults from all stocks approached the Norwegian coast
   concurrently, but Atlantic salmon >= 70 cm in natural tip length entered
   coastal water slightly earlier during summer than smaller fish. Atlantic
   salmon < 70 cm, however, ascended the river significantly earlier and at
   lower water flow and higher water temperature than larger fish. Although
   largest in size, the fish from the northern populations (62-69 degrees
   N) ascended the River Imsa almost 1 month earlier than those from the
   south (59-60 degrees N). They seemed less restricted by the
   environmental factors than the fish originating from the more southern
   rivers. There was no apparent trend among years in time of river ascent.
   Maximum ascent per day occurred at water discharges between 12.5 and 15
   m(3) s(-1) and at water temperatures between 10 and 12.5 degrees C.
   There was a significant positive correlation between water flow and
   river ascent during the first part of the upstream run from July to
   September with best correlation for September, when multiple regression
   analysis indicated that water temperature had an additional positive
   effect. Stock origin, fish size and water discharge were important
   variables influencing the upstream migration of Atlantic salmon in small
   rivers. (c) 2007 The Authors.},

Abstract = {This study quantified the use of cool water sources by wild 0+, 1+ and
   2+ year Atlantic salmon Salmo salar during high water temperatures (i.e.
   > 23 degrees C) in summer 1995 and 2004. During these events, 0+ year
   Atlantic salmon did not aggregate or increase in abundance in cool water
   sites. Interestingly, 1+ and 2+ year Atlantic salmon numbers increased
   in cool water sites. In addition, these older juveniles formed numerous,
   discrete aggregations along the plume created by a tributary with
   aggregation locations being similar between years. Aged 2+ year fish
   aggregations were at the coolest sources whereas 1+ year aggregations
   were in locations cooler than the main river. Fish in aggregations on
   average used deeper sections (average depth: 380 mm) compared with the
   coolest available habitat in the thermal plume (average depth: 230 mm).
   Hence, during high temperature events, older juvenile Atlantic salmon
   moved to cooler water sites and then aggregated in deeper microhabitats.

Title = {Use of winter habitat by roe deer at a northern latitude where Eurasian
   lynx are present},

Abstract = {Winter climate at northern latitudes is a challenge to small-bodied
   ungulates, and they modify behaviour to save energy and to increase the
   likelihood of survival. Also, the ongoing expansion of large carnivores
   in several European countries can lead to the recovery of (potentially
   energetically costly) anti-predator behaviours. In an area recently
   recolonized by Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, we snow-tracked radio-collared
   roe deer Capreolus capreolus in order to investigate their bedding and
   feeding behaviour during winter, and assess how environmental factors
   affect their habitat use. We also tested the prediction that roe deer
   use more open sites than locally available in areas with a stalking
   predator such as the lynx. Our results showed that both bed sites and
   foraging sites had more cover, compared with random sites. Most of the
   variation in canopy cover and in the distance and foraging sites between
   bed sites and foraging sites was explained by prevailing weather. As the
   winter progressed, the presumed depletion of fat reserves promoted the
   use of more canopy cover at foraging sites by night, less by day and a
   decrease in the distance between beds, foraging sites and human
   activities. Males used artificial feeding sites less often and bedded
   further from humans than females. The data fit the hypothesis of tighter
   energy budgets for family groups (females with fawns) or that males are
   more cautious towards humans. There was no support for the hypothesis
   that roe deer used more open habitat than locally available in order to
   reduce their vulnerability to lynx predation. Owing to severe winter
   conditions and the danger of starvation, roe deer seem to be forced to
   accept a high risk when predators are present, not changing their main
   pattern of habitat use from comparative areas where predators are
   absent.},

Abstract = {During four breeding seasons, 2003-2006, we studied the relationship
   between snow cover and nesting performance in pink-footed geese (Anser
   brachyrhynchus) in a key breeding site on Svalbard. Snow cover in late
   May, i.e., at the time of egg laying of geese, was derived from MODIS
   satellite images. Snow cover had a profound cascading effect on
   reproductive output via the number of nesting pairs and timing of
   nesting, which affected nest success, while there was only a tendency
   for a negative effect on clutch size. Hence, we estimated a five-fold
   difference in the number of young produced (to post-hatching) between
   years with little snow and years with high snow cover. The results from
   the study area correlated with whole-population productivity estimates
   recorded in autumn. Thus, snow cover derived from MODIS satellite images
   appears to provide a useful indicator of the breeding conditions in the
   Arctic.},

Journal = {ZOOTAXA},

Number = {1588},

Abstract = {Old- growth tropical forests are widely believed to be immune to the
   establishment of alien species. Collections from tropical regions
   throughout the world, however, have established that this generalization
   does not apply to inbreeding host generalist bark and ambrosia beetles.
   Scolytine saproxylophages are readily spread by shipping, inbreeders can
   easily establish new populations, and host generalists readily find new
   breeding material, apparently regardless of stage of forest succession.
   Consequently, many inbreeding scolytines are globally distributed and
   abundant in all forest types, often being among the dominant species in
   their wood- borer communities. We report the recent introductions to
   lower Central America of two Old World inbreeding ambrosia beetles:
   Xylosandrus crassiusculus, which breeds primarily in smaller diameter
   trunks, small branches, and twigs, and Xyleborinus exiguus, which is
   apparently not size selective. We also document the establishment of
   Euwallacea fornicatus in the region, known previously from a single
   collection in Panama. Xylosandrus crassiusculus and E. fornicatus are
   notorious agricultural and forestry pests, as are several previously
   established alien species in the region. Studying the spread of species
   such as these three new arrivals into millions of years- old faunas
   could help us to understand if the saproxylic communities of old- growth
   tropical forests are peculiarly vulnerable to invasion.},

Abstract = {Understanding and predicting population spread rates is an important
   problem in basic and applied ecology. In this article, we link estimates
   of invasion wave speeds to species traits and environmental conditions.
   We present detailed field studies of wind dispersal and compare
   nonparametric (i.e., data-based) and mechanistic ( fluid dynamics
   model-based) dispersal kernel and spread rate estimates for two
   important invasive weeds, Carduus nutans and Carduus acanthoides. A
   high-effort trapping design revealed highly leptokurtic dispersal
   distributions, with seeds caught up to 96 m from the source, far further
   than mean dispersal distances (approx. 2m). Nonparametric wave speed
   estimates are highly sensitive to sampling effort. Mechanistic estimates
   are insensitive to sampling because they are obtained from independent
   data and more useful because they are based on the dispersal mechanism.
   Over a wide range of realistic conditions, mechanistic spread rate
   estimates were most sensitive to high winds and low seed settling
   velocities. The combination of integrodifference equations and
   mechanistic dispersal models is a powerful tool for estimating invasion
   spread rates and for linking these estimates to characteristics of the
   species and the environment.},

Abstract = {This article examines the recent convergence of community-based and
   transboundary natural resource management in Africa. We suggest that
   both approaches have potential application to common-pool resources such
   as floodplain fisheries. However, a merging of transboundary and
   community-based management may reinforce oversimplifications about
   heterogeneity in resources, users, and institutions. A scalar mismatch
   between the ecosystem of concern in transboundary management and local
   resources of concern in community-based management, as well as different
   colonial and post-colonial histories contribute to this heterogeneity.
   We describe a fishery shared by Namibia and Zambia in terms of hybrid
   fisheries management. We examine settlement patterns, fishermen
   characteristics, sources of conflict, and perceptions regarding present
   and potential forms of fisheries management in the area. We also
   consider the implications that initiatives to manage resources on the
   local and ecosystem scale have for these fishing livelihoods. Our
   findings indicate that important social factors, such as the unequal
   distribution of population and fishing effort, as well as mixed opinions
   regarding present and future responsibility for fisheries management
   will complicate attempts to implement a hybrid community-transboundary
   management initiative.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Ungulate carcasses can have important effects on the surrounding soil
   and vegetation. The impact of six carcasses of European bison (Bison
   bonasus) was investigated for the first time in a natural temperate
   forest (Bialeowieza, Poland) by measuring soil and plant nutrient
   concentrations along a gradient extending from the centre of each
   carcass. Calcium concentration and pH were found to be higher at the
   centre of the carcass, decreasing towards the periphery. This effect
   lasted up to 7 years after the death of the animal. The concentration of
   most nutrients in the soil and plants varied irregularly, suggesting an
   effect of the carcass at its centre but the absence of a clear pattern
   of variation along the gradient. Concentrations of NO3- in the soil
   differed only at the 1-year old carcass, suggesting a fast turnover of
   nitrate in temperate forests. Our results show that the effects of large
   herbivore carcasses on soil and plant nutrient concentrations are not
   easily detectable in a temperate forest as in more homogeneous habitats,
   such as tundra and prairie. This may be due to the high activity of
   scavengers and nutrient recycling in the study area, but it may also be
   a consequence of a more complex and patchy interaction between nutrient
   availability and other limiting factors in temperate forests.},

Title = {Shelter availability affects behaviour, size-dependent and mean growth
   of juvenile Atlantic salmon},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {52},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1710-1718},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. Anthropogenic disturbances of the physical habitat and corresponding
   effects on fish performance are key issues in stream conservation and
   restoration. Reduced habitat complexity because of increased sediment
   loadings and canalization is of particular importance, but it is not
   clear to what extent fish populations are influenced directly by changes
   in the physical environment, or indirectly through changes in the biotic
   environment affecting the food availability.
   2. Here, we test for the direct effect of habitat complexity on the
   performance (growth) of juvenile Atlantic salmon by manipulating shelter
   availability (interstitial spaces in the substrate) across 20
   semi-natural stream channels without altering the substrate composition,
   and stocking each channel with a common density of fish. A simple method
   for measuring salmonid shelters using flexible PVC tubes was developed
   and tested. Daytime sheltering behaviour and growth rates were compared
   across the channels differing in shelter availability.
   3. Measured shelter availability was strongly negatively correlated with
   observed number of fish not finding shelters and mass loss rates of the
   fish (growth performance) increased with decreasing number of measured
   shelters. Number and mean depth of interstitial spaces explained up to
   68\% and 24\% of the among-channel variation in sheltering behaviour and
   growth performance, respectively. Furthermore, negative effects of
   shelter reduction increased with fish body size. Thus, changes in
   habitat structure may even influence the size selection gradients.
   4. Shelter availability is an easily measured variable, possibly
   affecting the population demographics and long-term evolutionary
   processes, and is therefore a key habitat factor to be considered in
   stream restoration and habitat classification.},

Title = {Territory occupancy rate of goshawk and gyrfalcon: no evidence of
   delayed numerical response to grouse numbers},

Abstract = {Two recent studies on territory occupancy rates of goshawk Accipiter
   gentilis and gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus report a 2-3-year-delayed
   numerical response to grouse numbers, which is a requirement for a
   hypothesis of predator-generated grouse cycles. The time lags were
   assumed to reflect the average age of sexual maturity in the raptor
   species. In southern Norway, however, subadult (two-year-old) goshawk
   hens occupied only 18-25\% of territories where occupancy was not
   recorded in the preceding year, and there was no significant
   relationship between the proportion of subadults among recruits and
   grouse indices two years earlier. We argue that territory occupancy
   rates are not appropriate indices of total raptor population levels, but
   rather reflect the proportion of territorial pairs that attempt to nest.
   Because this depends on the body condition of the hens, fluctuations in
   other important winter resident prey species (most important for the
   goshawk) and winter weather (most important for the gyrfalcon) should
   also be addressed. During 1988-2006, the annual proportion of goshawk
   territories with recorded nesting attempts in southern Norway was most
   closely related to the preceding autumn's population indices of black
   grouse Tetrao tetrix and mountain hare Lepus timidus, whereas the annual
   proportion of gyrfalcon territories with observations of falcons or with
   confirmed breeding attempts in central Norway were best explained by
   population indices of willow grouse Lagopus lagopus and ptarmigan L.
   mutus from the previous autumn, and by December temperatures. Hence, our
   studies do not support the predation hypothesis for grouse cycles.},

   Polychaetes (175 species in total) and isopods (383 species) had a high
   proportion of species restricted to one or two sites (72 and 70\%,
   respectively). Bivalves (46 species) had a higher proportion of species
   represented at more sites. Beta diversity (Whittaker and Jaccard) was
   higher for polychaetes and isopods than for bivalves. The impact of
   depth on species richness was not consistent among groups; polychaetes
   showed a negative relationship to depth, isopods displayed highest
   richness in the middle depth range (2,000-4,000 m), whereas bivalves
   showed no clear relationship to depth. Species richness was not related

Title = {Monitoring population size of red deer Cervus elaphus: an evaluation of

Year = {2007},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Proper management of wildlife relies on metrics of population
   development. Typically, the best estimation techniques are too expensive
   for coarse-scale management. In marine fisheries, catch-per-unit effort
   is, commonly used, but problems may arise due to changes in spatial
   harvest effort or in habitat use as density changes. Managers in Norway
   are in the early phases of implementing `seen deer' during harvesting
   and `spring counts' on farmland as a means of monitoring red deer Cervus
   elaphus populations. We provide a first evaluation of how suitable these
   methods are by comparing the results with population estimates obtained
   using cohort analysis, and by analysing the within-season variation in
   number of seen deer. `Seen deer' predicted annual increases in
   populations fairly well. Adjusting for harvesting effort provided less
   good estimates, due to a proportionally larger increase in effort
   relative to deer population size as population size increased. The
   number of seen deer per day decreased rapidly at the beginning of the
   season, and then levelled off or increased slightly during the rut,
   especially on farmland. The number of seen deer increased both with the
   number of harvesters and hours harvested, but at a diminishing rate. The
   current practice of `spring counts' was not successful in predicting
   population changes, probably due to a lack of replication. Indeed, date
   strongly affected the number of deer seen during spring counts. While
   `seen deer' seems to be a very promising tool for monitoring population
   size of red deer, there are some limitations to the practice as
   implemented for moose Alces alces in Scandinavia due to a more complex
   relationship with harvesting effort. Our study highlights that the large
   number of hours harvesters observe wildlife can provide a useful tool
   for population monitoring. However, the use of such indices may vary
   between species and according to harvest techniques and should thus be
   assessed with care before implementation.},

Abstract = {Brown bears (Ursus arctos) are threatened by habitat loss, habitat
   fragmentation by infrastructure and human settlements, and have been
   hunted to local extinction in large areas of their former range. We
   analyzed the habitat use during the non denning period of 106
   radio-collared bears in an expanding bear population in Sweden in
   relation to resorts and towns, terrain ruggedness, sex and age of bears.
   Bear use increased substantially with increasing distance to towns and
   resorts for comparable habitat and terrain types, also for independent
   scat surveys using DNA-analyses. More than 74\% of all female bear
   locations were in the 29\% of the terrain classified as ``rugged{''} and
   located > 10 krn from any town or resort, whereas similar habitat closer
   to towns or resorts was avoided. Bears closer to larger settlements and
   resorts (< 10 km) were on average 27-51\% younger than in areas beyond
   (mean 4.4 +/- 0.4 versus 8.9 +/- 0.8 years for males and 4.4 +/- 0.4
   versus 6.0 +/- 0.2 years for females). Sub-adult bears (< 4 years)
   comprised up to 52\% of all bear use within 10 km from resorts and
   settlements, likely representing exploratory dispersing individuals.
   These areas, however, contained only 8\% of the old males (> 7 years),
   the remaining 92\% located beyond 10 km from major resorts and
   settlements. Recreational resorts are developing rapidly, typically near
   national parks, and may thus limit expansion or fragment existing bear
   habitats. Together with active conservation, safeguarding undeveloped
   corridors of forest and rugged terrain may be important for successful
   recolonization of the brown bear into its original range. (c) 2007

Abstract = {We used long-term monitoring (1991-2005) data from a moose (Alces alces
   (L., 1758)) population (i) to determine if moose cows are faithful to
   their calving sites and (ii) to examine the effect of previous
   recruitment success on calving-site fidelity. We generated null
   hypotheses from the distances between calving sites used by other
   individuals inside the home range of each cow. The calving sites used in
   successive years by individual cows were closer together (2.1 +/- 0.2
   km) than were calving sites used by other cows within their home range
   (3.9 +/- 0.1 km; n = 30 cows, 148 sites). The former is similar to
   distances reported from areas where natural predators are present but
   females successfully weaned their calf or calves. We did not detect any
   effects of previous recruitment success, but the distances to the next
   calving sites of the only two cows that did not wean their calves (3.8
   and 3.4 km) are analogous to values reported for cows that have lost
   their calf or calves to predators. Our data support the theory that
   fidelity to areas where parturition has been successful could be an
   evolutionary trade-off between reproductive success and risk of
   predation to maximize fitness. On an ecological scale, moose cows
   apparently perceived anthropogenic disturbances as a potential risk,
   influencing their choice of calving sites and ultimately their fidelity.},

Title = {Induced shift in ecosystem productivity ? Extensive scale effects of
   abundant large herbivores},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Pages = {773-789},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Abundant large herbivores can strongly alter vegetation composition,
   shifting the ecosystem into a lasting state of changed productivity.
   Previous studies of the effects of abundant reindeer on alpine and
   arctic vegetation have yielded equivocal results, probably due to
   differing environmental contexts. To overcome context dependency we
   devised a large-scale survey in the region of Finnmark, northern Norway,
   possessing some of the most densely stocked reindeer herds in the world.
   The effects of reindeer abundance on summer pasture vegetation were
   assessed by employing a quasi-experimental design, including site
   fertility as a potential modifier of the reindeer-vegetation
   interaction. The study design comprised ten pairs of neighboring
   management districts (encompassing 18,003 km(2)), where over the two
   last decades a high-density district on average had reindeer densities
   more than twice as high and calf weights consistently lower than the
   low-density district. The abundance of different plant functional
   groups, ranging from those having facilitating to retarding effects on
   ecosystem productivity, were quantified by the point intercept method on
   plots selected according to a hierarchical, stratified random sampling
   design. Species with strong retarding effects on ecosystem productivity
   (for example, ericoids) were by far the most abundant. However, we found
   no consistent effects of reindeer density on their abundance. The most
   consistent differences between high- and low-density districts were
   found in plant functional groups with facilitating to neutral effects on
   ecosystem productivity. In particular, the abundance of N-facilitators,
   large dicotyledons and grasses were substantially reduced in the
   high-density districts. However, this reduction was restricted to
   fertile sites. Thus, reindeer when present at high densities have
   homogenized the biomass of palatable plants across environmental
   productivity gradients according to predictions from exploitation
   ecosystem models. Such reduction of plants with facilitating to neutral
   effects on ecosystem productivity indicates a reduced state of ecosystem
   productivity in high-density districts.},

Abstract = {Fennoscandia is characterized by a large degree of climatic diversity.
   Vegetation phenology may respond differently to climate change according
   to the climatic gradients within the region. To map the annual and
   spatial variability of the start of the growing season ( SOS) in
   Fennoscandia, the twice-monthly GIMMS-NDVI satellite dataset was used.
   The data set has an 8 x 8 km(2) spatial resolution and covers the period
   from 1982 to 2002. The mapping was done by applying pixel-specific
   threshold values to the NDVI data. These threshold values were
   determined form surface phenology data on birch ( Betula sp.). Then, we
   produced NDVI based maps of SOS for each of the 21 years. Finally, the
   time differences between the SOS and the last day of snow cover, as well
   as dates of passing different temperatures, were analyzed for 21
   meteorological stations. The analyses showed that 1985 was the most
   extreme year in terms of late SOS. In terms of early SOS, the year 1990
   was by far the most extreme. Locally, the SOS has an average range of 1
   month between the earliest and latest recorded SOS, with a trend towards
   a bigger range in the oceanic parts. The results indicate that a 1
   degrees C increase in spring temperatures in general corresponds to an
   advancement of 5-6 days in SOS. However, there is a clear trend
   according to the degree of oceanity, with a 1 degrees C increase in the
   most oceanic parts corresponding roughly to 7-9 days earlier SOS,
   compared to less than 5 days earlier in the continental parts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6},
Pages = {314-320},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {(1) Seasonal variation in thermal preference of Arctic charr from a
   North Norwegian population (70 degrees N) was studied in an electronic
   shuttlebox, which allowed the fish to control the water temperature by
   moving between two chambers. The fish were acclimated to 12 degrees C
   and a natural photoperiod before measurements. Fish were tested in
   autumn (September-October), winter (January February), spring
   (April-May) and summer (June-August).
   (2) Arctic charr showed a stable preference temperature of 11.5-11.8
   degrees C from spring to autumn and a drop in preference temperature to
   8.7 degrees C in winter.
   (3) In summer, the preference temperature of the charr coincided with
   environmental temperatures in their native lake, whereas during the
   other seasons, the preference temperatures were higher.
   (4) Overall, there was a positive correlation between individual fish
   growth rate and preference temperature, suggesting that the seasonal
   variation in preference temperature may be connected to seasonal
   variation in food intake and feeding motivation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {In North America, brown bears (Ursus arctos) can be a significant
   predator on moose (Alces alces) calves. Our study in Sweden is the first
   in which brown bears are the only predator on moose calves. Bears and
   moose occurred at densities of about 30/1,000 km(2) and 920/1,000 km(2),
   respectively, and bears killed about 26\% of the calves. Ninety-two
   percent of the predation took place when calves were <1 month old. Bear
   predation was probably additive to other natural mortality, which was
   about 10\% in areas both with and without bears. Females that lost their
   calves in spring produced more calves the following year (1.54 calves/F)
   than females that kept their calves (1.11 calves/F), which reduced the
   net loss of calves due to predation to about 22\%.},

Abstract = {The scope of this paper is to present a landscape analysis which allows
   for the inclusion of dynamics through time and the cultural diversity of

   presented as maps representing different periods in time. We also
   generate character areas from modern land use and geological maps on the
   basis of the elements which dominate the landscape today. Finally, we
   combine the time images with the character areas to present functional
   units in a manner which includes time depth. The method is described
   through examples from a municipality in southern Norway (Notteroy). The
   method is useful for defining cultural environments for the purpose of
   area planning and conservation, and is applicable on a general level.},

Title = {Brown bear body mass and growth in northern and southern Europe},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {153},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-47},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We tested six hypotheses to explain expected geographical differences in
   body masses of 1,771 brown bears (Ursus arctos) from northern and
   southern Europe (Sweden and Norway compared with Slovenia and Croatia):
   Bergmann's rule, the fasting endurance hypothesis, and the dietary meat
   hypothesis, which predicted larger bears in the north; and hypotheses
   stressing the role of high primary productivity, high population
   density, low seasonality, and length of the growing season, which
   predicted larger bears in the south. Although brown bear populations in
   North America vary greatly in body mass, we found no significant
   difference in body mass between the two European populations using a new
   analytical approach incorporating modeled age-standardized body masses
   in linear models, when correcting for sex and season. The greater
   variation in North America may be due primarily to the presence of large
   bears that feed on salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), which does not occur in
   Europe. Asymptotic body masses were 115 +/- 9 (SE) kg in spring and 141
   +/- 9 kg in autumn for southern females, 248 +/- 25 and 243 +/- 24 kg
   for southern males, 96 +/- 2 and 158 +/- 4 kg for northern females, and
   201 +/- 4 and 273 +/- 6 kg for northern males, respectively. Northern
   bears gained more body mass before hibernation and lost more during
   hibernation than southern bears, probably because hibernation was twice
   as long in the north. Northern bears gained and southern bears lost mass
   during the spring, perhaps due to the greater availability and use of
   protein-rich food in spring in the north. As reproductive success in
   bears is correlated with adult female body mass in interpopulation
   comparisons, brown bears may have relatively similar reproductive rates
   throughout Europe, although minimum age at primiparity and litter
   interval are lower in the south.},

Abstract = {In the Republic of Panamd, phytophagous beetles were collected by hand
   and beating from superficially similar generalist blossoms of Nectandra
   umbrosa (Lauraceae) and Tapirira guianensis (Anacardiaceae), two
   phylogenetically distant Neotropical canopy trees. Beetles were sorted
   into three functional groups (guilds): general flower visitors, species
   developing in buds, and seed predators. Out of a total of' 1,564
   collected specimens belonging to 177 beetle species, 55 species or 31\%
   were identifiable to specific epithet. These small- to mediumsized
   beetles belonged to four families: Cerambycidae, Chrysomelidae,
   Brentidae, and Curculionidae. A total of 723 beetles representing 121
   species, and 841 beetles representing 121 species were recorded from N.
   umbrosa and T guionensis, respectively. Of the beetles collected, 65
   species were common to both trees, which equates to a similarity index
   value of 0.46 (Jaccard) or 0.34 (Sorensen). With respect to functional
   groups, there was no significant difference in the number of beetle
   species between the two tree species. Overall, beetle abundance patterns
   on flowers of the two trees are similar in terms of phytophagous beetle
   subfamily dominance. There are differences however, significantly more
   leaf beetles (Cryptocephalinae, Eurnolpinae, Galerucinae) were collected
   per hour on T guianensis than on N. umbrosa. Moreover, among beetles
   shared between the two tree species, Baridinae weevils showed a tendency
   to be more abundant on N. umbrosa. Nearly three-quarters of the flower
   feeders (72\%) were shared between the two trees. The large overlap in
   beetle species between the two plant species suggests that the fauna is
   fairly general in terms of host use. We discuss the possible
   significance of our results to phytophagous beetle and host plant
   evolution. The combined effects of large species numbers, high abundance
   and broad diet breadth across generalist flowers of tropical canopy
   trees suggests that small- to medium-sized beetles play a crucial role
   in maintenance of species biodiversity and forest ecosystem function.},

Abstract = {Previous ecotoxicological studies have documented relationships between
   residues of various organochlorines (OCs) and immune status, carotenoid
   colors, and wing feather growth in different bird species. In this
   study, the density of white blood cells (WBC), carotenoid colors, and
   length of the same feathers on each wing were measured in breeding great
   black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) on the coast of northern Norway, and
   related to the blood residues of five OCs, including HCB
   (hexachlorobenzene), beta-HCH (beta-hexachlorocyclohexane), p,p `-DDE
   (p, p `-dichlorodipheiiyldichloroethylene), oxychlordane, and
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), in addition to Sigma OC. Neither, WBC
   density nor carotenoid colors were significantly related to blood
   residues of any of the OCs, suggesting that OC levels may have been too
   low to significantly affect these outcome parameters. However, in the
   colony where the OC concentrations were highest, there was a weak but
   significantly positive relationship between the probability of having
   different length of feathers on each wing and levels of PCB and Sigma
   OC, in males. Thus varying length of the wing primaries may reflect
   adverse impacts of OCs in great black-backed gulls. However, in gulls
   with moderate levels of OCs, it is probably not a sensitive indicator of
   progressing ecological impacts of OCs, since such adverse ecological
   relationships were found in the breeding colonies where there were no
   relationships between differences in wing feather lengths and OCs.},

Abstract = {Whether climate change will turn cold biomes from large long-term carbon
   sinks into sources is hotly debated because of the great potential for
   ecosystem-mediated feedbacks to global climate. Critical are the
   direction, magnitude and generality of climate responses of plant litter
   decomposition. Here, we present the first quantitative analysis of the
   major climate-change-related drivers of litter decomposition rates in
   cold northern biomes worldwide. Leaf litters collected from the
   predominant species in 33 global change manipulation experiments in
   circum-arctic-alpine ecosystems were incubated simultaneously in two
   contrasting arctic life zones. We demonstrate that longer-term,
   large-scale changes to leaf litter decomposition will be driven
   primarily by both direct warming effects and concomitant shifts in plant
   growth form composition, with a much smaller role for changes in litter
   quality within species. Specifically, the ongoing warming-induced
   expansion of shrubs with recalcitrant leaf litter across cold biomes
   would constitute a negative feedback to global warming. Depending on the
   strength of other (previously reported) positive feedbacks of shrub
   expansion on soil carbon turnover, this may partly counteract direct
   warming enhancement of litter decomposition.},

Title = {Long-term effects of catch-and-release angling on ascending Atlantic

Volume = {85},

Abstract = {Eighteen Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (total body length 58-110 cm)
   were radio tagged following angling and then released in the lower
   reaches of the River Alta, Northern Norway. The aim was to compare the
   long-term effects of catch-and-release angling on newly ascended salmon
   (assumed < 1 week in freshwater) with salmon from a previous study that
   were released in the upper reaches of the river at the end of their
   upstream migration (assumed > 1 month in freshwater, n = 44, total body
   length 53-122 cm). All 18 salmon survived the catch-and-release angling
   event and were recorded in known spawning areas during the spawning
   period, except one individual not found in the river after 15 August (42
   days after tagging). There was no difference in survival rate between
   salmon caught-and-released in lower (17 of 18, 94\%) and upper reaches
   (43 of 44, 98\%), nor in the proportion recorded in known spawning areas
   (17 of 18, 94\%, from lower reaches and 42 of 44, 95\% from upper
   reaches). During the spawning period, four salmon (24\%) were recorded
   downstream of the catch-and-release site (mean 2.3 km, range 0.3-5.7),
   whereas 13 (76\%) salmon were upstream of the catch-and-release site
   (mean 10.1 km, range 1.9-24.0). Catch-and-release angling may result in
   a delay in the upstream migration, as the 13 fish recorded upstream of
   the catch-and-release site during spawning, spent on average 34 days
   (range 0-94) before they were recorded more than 1 km upstream from the
   catch-and-release site. This is a longer delay than expected for natural
   resting periods during upstream migration. In addition, at least 3 1 \%
   (n = 4) of the 13 fish recorded upstream of the catch-and-release site
   during spawning showed an unusual downstream movement immediately after
   catch-and-release angling. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A demographic comparison of two Nordic populations of Greylag Geese
   Anser anser},
Journal = {IBIS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {149},
Number = {3},
Pages = {553-563},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Greylag Geese Anser anser have been neck-banded on an annual basis in
   Scania, southern Sweden since 1984 and in Norway since 1986 as part of a
   Nordic Greylag project. This has yielded a large database of
   resightings, which we used here to estimate and compare survival rates
   between the two populations by means of mark-recapture models. Estimated
   adult survival was sex-dependent in the Scanian population, probably a
   result of differential neck band retention rates in this population.
   Mean juvenile survival was about 12\% higher in the Scanian population
   (0.603 vs. 0.485). Adult survival in the Norwegian population was 0.728
   (males 0.733; females 0.725), and in males and females from the Scanian
   population was 0.711 (0.752 after accounting for higher neck band loss
   in males) and 0.771, respectively. Over the course of the study,
   juvenile survival in the Scanian population increased substantially, and
   adult survival was constant, whereas both these parameters declined in
   the Norwegian population. This study demonstrates that the two Nordic
   populations are demographically distinct and gives further support to
   the notion that they should be treated as separate management units. The
   decline of 10\% in adult survival in the Norwegian population, the cause
   of which still remains uncertain, is likely to have had a major impact
   on the growth of this population.},

Title = {Population fluctuations and regulation in great snipe: a time-series
   analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {76},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. During the last centuries, the breeding range of the great snipe
   Gallinago media has declined dramatically in the western part of its
   distribution. To examine present population dynamics in the Scandinavian
   mountains, we collected and analysed a 19-year time series of counts of
   great snipe males at leks in central Norway, 1987-2005.
   2. The population showed large annual fluctuations in the number of
   males displaying at lek sites (range 45-90 males at the peak of the
   mating season), but no overall trend.
   3. We detected presence of direct density-dependent mechanisms
   regulating this population. Inclusion of the density-dependent term in a
   Ricker-type model significantly improved the fit with observed data
   (evaluated with Parametric Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio tests and Akaike's
   Information Criterion for small sample size).
   4. An analysis of (a number of a priori likely) environmental covariates
   suggests that the population dynamics were affected by conditions
   influencing reproduction and survival of offspring during the summer,
   but not by conditions influencing survival at the wintering grounds in
   Africa. This is in contrast to many altricial birds breeding in the
   northern hemisphere, and supports the idea that population dynamics of
   migratory nidifugous birds are more influenced by conditions during
   reproduction.
   5. Inclusion of these external factors into our model improved the
   detectability of density dependence. This illustrates that allowing for
   external effects may increase statistical power of density dependence
   tests and thus be of particular importance in relatively short time
   series.
   6. In our best model of the population dynamics, two likely
   density-independent offspring survival covariates explained 47.3\% of
   the variance in great snipe numbers (predation pressure estimated by
   willow grouse reproductive success and food availability estimated by
   the amount of precipitation in June), whereas density dependence
   explained 35.5\%. Demographic stochasticity and unidentified
   environmental stochasticity may account for the remaining 17.2\%.},

Title = {Phylogeography of the white-tailed eagle, a generalist with large

Abstract = {Aim Late Pleistocene glacial changes had a major impact on many boreal
   and temperate taxa, and this impact can still be detected in the
   present-day phylogeographic structure of these taxa. However, only minor
   effects are expected in species with generalist habitat requirements and
   high dispersal capability. One such species is the white-tailed eagle,
   Haliaeetus albicilla, and we therefore tested for the expected weak
   population structure at a continental level in this species. This also
   allowed us to describe phylogeographic patterns, and to deduce Ice Age
   refugia and patterns of postglacial recolonization of Eurasia.
   Location Breeding populations from the easternmost Nearctic (Greenland)
   and across the Palaearctic (Iceland, continental Europe, central and
   eastern Asia, and Japan).
   Methods Sequencing of a 500 base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA
   control region in 237 samples from throughout the distribution range.
   Results Our analysis revealed pronounced phylogeographic structure.
   Overall, low genetic variability was observed across the entire range.
   Haplotypes clustered in two distinct haplogroups with a predominantly
   eastern or western distribution, and extensive overlap in Europe. These
   two major lineages diverged during the late Pleistocene. The eastern
   haplogroup showed a pattern of rapid population expansion and
   colonization of Eurasia around the end of the Pleistocene. The western
   haplogroup had lower diversity and was absent from the populations in
   eastern Asia. These results suggest survival during the last glaciation
   in two refugia, probably located in central and western Eurasia,
   followed by postglacial population expansion and admixture. Relatively
   high genetic diversity was observed in northern regions that were
   ice-covered during the last glacial maximum. This, and phylogenetic
   relationships between haplotypes encountered in the north, indicates
   substantial population expansion at high latitudes. Areas of glacial
   meltwater runoff and proglacial lakes could have provided suitable
   habitats for such population growth.
   Main conclusions This study shows that glacial climate fluctuations had
   a substantial impact on white-tailed eagles, both in terms of
   distribution and demography. These results suggest that even species
   with large dispersal capabilities and relatively broad habitat
   requirements were strongly affected by the Pleistocene climatic shifts.},

   against altering assumptions about the additive genetic proportions of
   variance components. The homogenizing effect of gene flow (or a short
   time available for neutral divergence) has apparently been effectively
   counterbalanced by differential natural selection, although one trait
   showed some evidence of being under uniform stabilizing selection.
   Neutral markers can hence be misleading for identifying evolutionary
   significant units, and adopting the P-ST-F-ST approach might therefore
   be valuable when common garden experiments is not an option. We discuss
   the statistical difficulties of documenting uniform selection as opposed
   to divergent selection, and the need for estimating measurement error.
   Instead of only comparing overall Q(ST) and F-ST values, we advocate the
   use of partial matrix permutation tests to analyse pairwise Q(ST)
   differences among populations, while statistically controlling for
   neutral differentiation.},

Abstract = {Relationships between growth at sea, smolt size and age at sexual
   maturation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar were tested. The fish were
   offspring of brood stocks sampled in eight Norwegian rivers at latitudes
   between 59 degrees and 70 degrees N, hatchery reared and released at
   smolting at the mouth of the River Imsa (59 degrees N). Smolt size
   influenced the subsequent growth rate of Atlantic salmon. The larger the
   fish were at release, the slower the yearly length increment at sea.
   Mean sea age at sexual maturity, measured as proportion of the returning
   adults attaining sexual maturity at sea age 2 years, was significantly
   correlated with mean growth rate during the first year at sea and mean
   smolt size (r(2) = 0.74, P < 0.001). Fish attaining maturity at a
   relatively high sea age were more fast growing during their first year
   at sea than those maturing at a younger age. The results indicate that
   high sea age at sexual maturation is a population-specific
   characteristic and associated with high early growth rate at sea. (c)

Pages = {276-283},

Abstract = {We used logistic regression to compare a set of habitat features inside
   known Scandinavian wolf Canis lupus territories with the same habitat
   features in areas outside known territories, but still close enough to
   be available for wolf colonization. In addition, we analysed changes in
   habitat variables over time within wolf territories. Wolf territories
   had lower densities of roads, built-up areas and open land than areas
   outside wolf territories, but there was no difference in the density of
   the wolves' main prey, elk Alces alces. The logistic regression model
   classified 79\% of Scandinavia outside the reindeer husbandry area as
   suitable wolf habitat, that is with a probability of wolf occurrence >
   0.5. The proportion of built-up areas within the wolf territory
   decreased as the `borders' of the wolf territory changed over time. Our
   model had a reasonably high predictive power, with correct
   classification in 90\% (18 of 20) of the observed wolf territories in
   the study area. Polygons, randomly distributed outside the observed wolf
   territories, were correctly classified as not being occupied by wolves
   in 85\% of the cases (17 of 20). This allows a more effective use of
   resources to, for example, prevent wolf depredation on livestock and
   dogs.},

Abstract = {There is currently an active scientific debate about the most correct
   and efficient way to identify species. To date, few studies in the
   marine realm have combined the available taxonomic methods. In this
   study we have used morphology, ecology and molecular analyses to
   identify a new species within the bivalve genus Acesta. All four genes
   studied (12S, 16S, Cytb, COI) suggested that a common cold-seep species
   in the Gulf of Mexico, A. bullisi, should be divided into two distinct
   species. This conclusion was supported by morphological traits and by
   observations of ecological distribution. A. oophaga Jarnegren, Schander
   and Young n. sp. is described here, and A. bullisi Vokes (Tulane Stud
   Geol 2:75-92, 1963) is re-described. This study shows that DNA barcoding
   in combination with traditional morphological and ecological analyses
   may be an important tools to identify hidden biodiversity among
   deep-water organisms such as bivalves.},

Abstract = {Arctic Cervids face considerable challenges in sustaining life in a
   harsh and highly seasonal environment, and when to forage is a key
   component of the survival strategy. We predict that a cervid maximizes
   net intake of energy to change the duration of feeding-ruminating cycles
   depending on season, and pays no attention to light or other
   activity-entraining cues. Still, in periods of bad weather it may pay
   energetically to reduce exposure and heat loss. We investigated
   environmental impact on the seasonal and daily activity pattern of a
   food-limited, predator-free arctic deer, the Svalbard reindeer. We found
   that the reindeer indeed had season-dependent feeding-rumination
   intervals, with no distinct peaks in activity at sunrise and sunset, as
   would be expected if animals maximize energy intake rates in
   predator-free environments. However, they temporarily reduced activity
   when exposed to low temperature and increased precipitation during
   winter, possibly to conserve energy. We provide insight into the
   behavioural strategy of Svalbard reindeer which enables them to cope
   with such an extreme environment.},

Abstract = {Droughts and forest fires, induced by the El Nino/Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) event, have increased considerably over the last decades
   affecting millions of hectares of rainforest. We investigated the
   effects of the 1997 - 1998 forest fires and drought, associated with an
   exceptionally severe ENSO event, on fruit species important in the diet
   of Malayan sun bears (Helarctos malayanus) in lowland dipterocarp
   forest, East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. Densities of sun bear fruit
   trees (>= 10 cm DBH) were reduced by similar to 80\%, from 167 +/- 41
   (SD) fruit trees ha(-1) in unburned forest to 37 +/- 18 fruit trees
   ha(-1) in burned forest. Densities of hemi-epiphytic figs, one of the
   main fallback resources for sun bears during periods of food scarcity,
   declined by 95\% in burned forest. Species diversity of sun bear food
   trees decreased by 44\% in burned forest. Drought also affected sun bear
   fruit trees in unburned primary forest, with elevated mortality rates
   for the duration of 2 years, returning to levels reported as normal in
   region in the third year after the ENSO event. Mortality in unburned
   forest near the burn-edge was higher ( 25 +/- 5\% of trees 10 cm DBH
   dead) than in the forest interior ( 14 +/- 5\% of trees), indicating
   possible edge effects. Combined effects of fire and drought in burned
   primary forest resulted in an overall tree mortality of 78 +/- 11\% (>=
   10 cm DBH) 33 months after the fire event. Disturbance due to fires has
   resulted in a serious decline of fruit resources for sun bears and, due
   to the scale of fire damage, in a serious decline of prime sun bear
   habitat. Recovery of sun bear populations in these burned-over forests
   will depend on regeneration of the forest, its future species
   composition, and efforts to prevent subsequent fire events.},

Title = {Factors influencing conservation attitudes of local people in Western
   Serengeti, Tanzania},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2213-2230},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Attitudinal studies are increasingly being adopted as tools for
   evaluating public understanding, acceptance and the impact of
   conservation interventions. The findings of these studies have been
   useful in guiding the policy interventions. Many factors affect
   conservation attitudes positively or negatively. The factors inspiring
   positive attitudes are likely to enhance the conservation objectives
   while those inducing negative attitudes may detrimentally undermine
   these objectives. The magnitude of the resultant effects of each
   particular factor is determined by the historical, political,
   ecological, socio-cultural and economic conditions and this may call for
   different management interventions. In this study we examined how
   conservation attitudes in western Serengeti are shaped by the following
   factors: level of conflicts with protected areas; wildlife imposed
   constraints (inadequate pasture, water, diseases, loss of livestock
   during migration, theft and depredation); participation in the community
   based project; and socio-demographic factors (age, education level,
   wealth, immigration, gender and household size). The results indicated
   that the level of conflicts, participation in the community based
   project, inadequate pasture, lack of water, diseases, wealth and
   education were important in shaping peoples' attitudes. However, in a
   stepwise linear regression analysis, 59\% of the variation in peoples'
   attitudes was explained by three variables i.e., conflict level with
   protected areas, lack of water and participation in the community based
   project. In addition to these variables, level of education also
   contributed in explaining 51\% of the variation in people's attitude
   regarding the status of the game reserves. Five variables (lack of
   water, level of education, inadequate pasture, participation in the
   community based project and diseases) explained 12\% of the variation in
   people's attitude towards Serengeti National Park. The paper discusses
   the implications for conservation of these results and recommends some
   measures to realise effective conservation of wildlife resources.},

Abstract = {Estimating the population growth rate and environmental stochasticity of
   long-lived species is difficult because annual variation in population
   size is influenced by temporal autocorrelations caused by fluctuations
   in the age-structure. Here we use the dynamics of the reproductive value
   to estimate the long-term growth rate s and the environmental variance
   sigma(2)(e) of a moose population that recently colonized the island of
   Vega in northern Norway. We show that the population growth rate was
   high ((s) over cap =0.26). The major stochastic influences on the
   population dynamics were due to demographic stochasticity, whereas the
   environmental variance was not significantly different from 0. This
   supports the suggestion that population growth rates of polytocous
   ungulates are high, and that demographic stochasticity must be assessed
   when estimating the growth of small ungulate populations.},

Title = {Can reindeer overabundance cause a trophic cascade?},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {607-622},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The region Finnmark, in northernmost Europe, harbors dense populations
   of semi-domestic reindeer of which some exhibit characteristics of
   overabundance. Whereas overabundance is evident in terms of
   density-dependent reductions in reindeer body mass, population growth
   and abundance of forage plants, claims have been made that this reindeer
   overabundance also has caused a trophic cascade. These claims are based
   on the main premise that reindeer overgrazing negatively impacts
   small-sized, keystone tundra herbivores. We tested this premise by a
   large-scale study in which the abundance of small rodents, hares and
   ptarmigans was indexed across reindeer management districts with strong
   differences in stocking densities. We examined the scale-dependent
   relations between reindeer, vegetation and these small-sized herbivores
   by employing a spatially hierarchical sampling design within the
   management districts. A negative impact of reindeer on ptarmigan,
   probably as a result of browsing reducing tall Salix, was indicated.
   However, small rodents (voles and lemmings), which are usually the
   keystone herbivores in the plant-based tundra food web, were not
   negatively impacted. On the contrary, there was a strong positive
   relationship between small rodents and reindeer, both at the scale of
   landscape areas and local patches, with characteristics of snow-bed
   vegetation, suggesting facilitation between Norwegian lemmings and
   reindeer. We conclude that the recent dampening of the vole and lemming
   population cycle with concurrent declines of rodent predators in
   northernmost Europe were not caused by large herbivore overgrazing.},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {To estimate wolf (Canis lupus) kill rates from fine-scale movement
   patterns, we followed adult wolves in 3 territories of the Scandinavian
   wolf population using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) during the
   winters of 2001-2003. The resulting 6 datasets of 62-84 study days gave
   a total of 8,747 hourly GPS positions. We visited clusters of positions
   in the field on average 8.8 days after positioning and found moose
   (Alces alces) killed by wolves during the study period on 74 (8\%) of
   the 953 dusters. The number of positions and visits to a cluster, their
   interaction, and the proportion of afternoon positions were significant
   fixed effects in mixed logistic-regression models predicting the
   probability of a cluster containing a wolf-killed moose. The models,
   however, displayed a poor goodness-of-fit and were not a suitable tool
   for estimating kill rates from positioning data alone. They might be
   used to reduce fieldwork by excluding unlikely clusters, although the
   reduction was not substantial. We discuss proximate factors (i.e., human
   disturbance and access to prey) as well as ultimate factors (i.e.,
   social organization, intra-guild dominance, and litter size) as
   potential causes of the observed high temporal and spatial variation in
   prey-handling. For similar future kill-rate studies, we recommend
   increasing field efforts and shortening positioning intervals.},

Abstract = {The life history of ungulates is affected by factors such as climate,
   population density and resource availability. With focus on the muskoxen
   Ovibos moschatus living in Kangerlussuaq in western Greenland, Jameson
   Land in north-eastern Greenland and on Banks and Victoria Islands in
   northern Canada, we tested spatial variation in life-history traits
   measured by mandibular growth. In accordance with expectations, we found
   that muskoxen in the southernmost and low Arctic area (Kangerlussuaq)
   grew faster, matured earlier, reproduced earlier, reached larger adult
   size and additionally had a higher reproduction than muskoxen living in
   the more northern areas. In the Kangerlussuaq population, mandible
   lengths in adult males changed temporally with density, with significant
   smaller adult males present in high population densities in western
   Greenland. It was especially the male mandible lengths that responded to
   environmental factors. In females, spatial differences were less
   pronounced than in males and is probably explained by females facing a
   trade-off between investment in own growth and reproduction, whereas a
   large body size is more important for the males, which are exposed to
   sexual selection. This explanation was, furthermore, supported by the
   fact that the calf percentage was higher in western Greenland than in
   any of the other studied areas in spite of the density-dependent effects
   detected within the male gender.},

Title = {Human attitudes towards large carnivores in Norway},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {172-185},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many factors influence human attitudes towards large carnivores. In our
   study we explore different factors that affect attitudes towards four
   such species, i.e. wolverines Gulo gulo, lynx Lynx lynx, brown bears
   Ursus arctos and wolves Canis lupus. We examined attitudes through a
   representative sample of the Norwegian population. By using 12
   independent variables chosen for this study, we were able to explain
   around 15-45\% of the variance in attitudes towards the four species. In
   general, people displayed more negative attitudes towards wolves and
   bears than towards lynx and wolverines. However, they were more positive
   towards increasing the small populations of the first two species than
   the relatively large populations of the last two. The results showed
   that 34-44\% of the respondents reacted negatively to the question `What
   do you think should be done about the size of the carnivore
   population?'. On the other hand, 73-87\% reacted positively to the
   question `Do these species have a right to exist in Norway?'. To the
   question `How far do you want the carnivore species from your home?',
   41-66\% answered > 10 km. The most important variables explaining
   negative attitudes towards all the large carnivore species regarded the
   concern of the respondents for their own and their family's safety.
   People became more negative with age; those who were afraid of the
   carnivores were in general more negative towards them, and those who
   experienced financial loss (i.e. farmers) by having large carnivores in
   their vicinity expressed negative attitudes. On the other hand, the
   excitement of seeing large carnivores in their natural environment had a
   positive influence on attitude. People from larger communities were in
   general more positive, whereas those who thought they had the species in
   their vicinity were more negative. Big-game hunters frequently showed
   negative attitudes, whereas those with higher levels of education tended
   to be more positive. Our results indicate that attitudes towards large
   carnivores are complex. However, people are in general more negative
   towards wolves and bears, which must be taken into account in
   conservation programmes.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims A standardized methodology to assess the impacts of
   land-use changes on vegetation and ecosystem functioning is presented.
   It assumes that species traits are central to these impacts, and is
   designed to be applicable in different historical, climatic contexts and
   local settings. Preliminary results are presented to show its
   applicability.
   Methods Eleven sites, representative of various types of land-use
   changes occurring in marginal agro-ecosystems across Europe and Israel,
   were selected. Climatic data were obtained at the site level; soil data,
   disturbance and nutrition indices were described at the plot level
   within sites. Sixteen traits describing plant stature, leaf
   characteristics and reproductive phase were recorded on the most
   abundant species of each treatment. These data were combined with
   species abundance to calculate trait values weighed by the abundance of
   species in the communities. The ecosystem properties selected were
   components of above-ground net primary productivity and decomposition of
   litter.
   Key Results The wide variety of land-use systems that characterize
   marginal landscapes across Europe was reflected by the different
   disturbance indices, and were also reflected in soil and/or nutrient
   availability gradients. The trait toolkit allowed us to describe
   adequately the functional response of vegetation to land-use changes,
   but we suggest that some traits (vegetative plant height, stem dry
   matter content) should be omitted in studies involving mainly herbaceous
   species. Using the example of the relationship between leaf dry matter
   content and above-ground dead material, we demonstrate how the data
   collected may be used to analyse direct effects of climate and land use
   on ecosystem properties vs. indirect effects via changes in plant
   traits.
   Conclusions This work shows the applicability of a set of protocols that
   can be widely applied to assess the impacts of global change drivers on
   species, communities and ecosystems.},

Abstract = {As well as being one of the most important aquaculture species, Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar) have been proposed as a model organism for studying
   the consequences of genome duplication, given the recent
   tetraploidization event in the salmonoid common ancestor. Availability
   of large nuntbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for Atlantic
   salmon would be extremely useful for both mapping of genes affecting
   quantitative traits, as well as a tool to establish the extent and
   location of duplication in the salmon genome. Here we describe the
   discovery of 2507 putative SNPs from the alignment of Atlantic salmon
   expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Eighty-six of the SNPs were chosen for
   validation in a panel of,55 salmon from locations across their range.
   Seventy four percent of these SNPs were polymorphic in this panel.
   Twelve of the validated SNPs showed extreme heterozygous excess, and
   partial genome duplication is proposed as a possible explanation for
   this result. Flanking SNP sequences are available from the authors, and
   the annotations of the SNP containing sequences are publicly available
   at http://www.salmongenome.no/data/ annotation/SNPproj. (c) 2007

Abstract = {Human exploitation can have severe conservation implications for
   wildlife populations. In the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, illegal
   hunting is a serious concern for wildlife management, and in this study
   we investigated if density, demography and behaviour can be used as
   indicators of human exploitation. We used impala (Aepycerus melampus) as
   a model species to study human exploitation inside and outside a
   strictly protected area. Over a six month period, a total of 2050 km of
   transects were driven in the different protected areas (National Park,
   Game Reserve, Open Area). Densities were estimated by using distance
   sampling and the partially protected areas were found to have
   significantly lower densities (4.3 ind/km(2)) than the National Park
   (15.3 ind/km(2)). A variation in density between different sections
   within the National Park was also found. However, we found no
   differences in group sizes. Moreover, the sex-ratio was more skewed
   towards females in the partially protected areas and in sections within
   the National Park close to villages. In addition, impalas showed higher
   alertness levels, and longer flight initiation distance to an
   approaching human in the partially protected areas compared to the
   National Park. The present harvest levels by illegal hunting in the
   study area are most likely the cause of the observed differences. Our
   results suggest that density, demography and behaviour can be used as
   indicators of human exploitation, but that this probably varies
   according to local hunting pressure. Furthermore, it could be expected
   that the results obtained in this study might reflect the state of other
   ungulates in the area, which raises concern whether management
   objectives for the buffer zones of Serengeti National Park are met. (c)

Title = {A critical review of adaptive genetic variation in Atlantic salmon:
   implications for conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-211},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Here we critically review the scale and extent of adaptive genetic
   variation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), an important model system
   in evolutionary and conservation biology that provides fundamental
   insights into population persistence, adaptive response and the effects
   of anthropogenic change. We consider the process of adaptation as the
   end product of natural selection, one that can best be viewed as the
   degree of matching between phenotype and environment. We recognise three
   potential sources of adaptive variation: heritable variation in
   phenotypic traits related to fitness, variation at the molecular level
   in genes influenced by selection, and variation in the way genes
   interact with the environment to produce phenotypes of varying
   plasticity. Of all phenotypic traits examined, variation in body size
   (or in correlated characters such as growth rates, age of seaward
   migration or age at sexual maturity) generally shows the highest
   heritability, as well as a strong effect on fitness. Thus, body size in
   Atlantic salmon tends to be positively correlated with freshwater and
   marine survival, as well as with fecundity, egg size, reproductive
   success, and offspring survival. By contrast, the fitness implications
   of variation in behavioural traits such as aggression, sheltering
   behaviour, or timing of migration are largely unkown. The adaptive
   significance of molecular variation in salmonids is also scant and
   largely circumstantial, despite extensive molecular screening on these
   species. Adaptive variation can result in local adaptations (LA) when,
   among other necessary conditions, populations live in patchy
   environments, exchange few or no migrants, and are subjected to
   differential selective pressures. Evidence for LA in Atlantic salmon is
   indirect and comes mostly from ecological correlates in fitness-related
   traits, the failure of many translocations, the poor performance of
   domesticated stocks, results of a few common-garden experiments (where
   different populations were raised in a common environment in an attempt
   to dissociate heritable from environmentally induced phenotypic
   variation), and the pattern of inherited resistance to some parasites
   and diseases. Genotype x environment interactions occurr for many
   fitness traits, suggesting that LA might be important. However, the
   scale and extent of adaptive variation remains poorly understood and
   probably varies, depending on habitat heterogeneity, environmental
   stability and the relative roles of selection and drift. As
   maladaptation often results from phenotype-environment mismatch, we
   argue that acting as if populations are not locally adapted carries a
   much greater risk of mismanagement than acting under the assumption for
   local adaptations when there are none. As such, an evolutionary approach
   to salmon conservation is required, aimed at maintaining the conditions
   necessary for natural selection to operate most efficiently and
   unhindered. This may require minimising alterations to native genotypes
   and habitats to which populations have likely become adapted, but also
   allowing for population size to reach or extend beyond carrying capacity
   to encourage competition and other sources of natural mortality.},

Abstract = {Possible links between plasma testosterone levels, heavy metal loads and

Abstract = {The tissues of willow ptarmigan in some Norwegian mountain areas contain
   elevated concentrations of cadmium (Cd). It is not known whether such
   high Cd levels would have negative impacts in otherwise healthy
   populations of this species. The aim of the current study was to clarify
   relationships between hepatic and renal metallothionein (MT) and Cd
   concentrations in willow ptarmigan to assess effects from this metal.
   The study reported here was undertaken on willow ptarmigan from the
   Kongsvoll area, with a naturally high Cd load, and the Essand area, with
   a naturally low Cd load. Cd values in liver and kidney in willow
   ptarmigan from Kongsvoll were significantly higher than in willow
   ptarmigan from Essand. The MT content in both tissues was also highest
   in willow ptarmigan from Kongsvoll. The MT concentration in kidney was
   twice that in liver for ptarmigan from both areas and at all times of
   the year. The MT level in both liver and kidney varied greatly
   throughout the season, with the highest content in spring (May). The
   variation was greatest in liver. The total material showed a significant
   linear relationship between Cd and MT levels in both liver and kidney,
   but a breakdown of the material into seasons and areas gave a varying
   degree of significance. MT in willow ptarmigan may be an important
   mechanism for detoxifying Cd, and populations exposed to high load may
   ``respond{''} to the loads by increasing MT synthesis in tissues such as
   liver and kidney. There is no evidence that willow ptarmigan from areas
   with high natural Cd loads have reached a limit for MT synthesis in
   either liver or kidney.},

Title = {Saami reindeer pastoralism under climate change: Applying a generalized

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {17},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A generalized vulnerability framework was used to structure an
   interdisciplinary and intercultural examination of factors that
   influence the ways in which reindeer pastoralism in Finnmark (northern
   Norway) may be affected by climate change. Regional and local
   (downscaled) climate projections included scenarios that can potentially
   influence foraging conditions for reindeer. None of the projections were
   without precedent; several climate change events in Finnmark during the
   last 100 years were at least as great as those projected in the next
   20-30 years. Herders' traditional responses to changes in both the
   natural and the socio-economic environments have depended on a
   flexibility in herding practice that is currently being eroded by
   several non-climate factors. The reduced of freedom of action resulting
   from loss of habitat, predation and aspects of governance (especially
   economic and legal constraints) potentially dwarves the putative effects
   of projected climate change on reindeer pastoralism. It may, however,
   also lead to situations in which new climatic conditions threaten the
   system in unprecedented ways. Developing appropriate methodologies for
   assessing the adaptive capacity, the vulnerability and the resilience of
   social-ecological systems to global changes remains a challenge.
   Recognition of the knowledge systems of Arctic cultures and the full
   engagement of local people throughout the process are key elements of
   the solution. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The autumn and spring descent of 41 brown trout kelts (spent trout)
   (average total length L-t 75.9 cm) and the spring descent of 27
   hatchery-reared smolts (average L-t 26.2 cm) were studied by
   radiotelemetry in 1993/1994 (kelts) and 1997/1998 (kelts and smolts) at
   the Hunderfossen dam and power plant, south-east Norway. In 1999 we
   studied spring descent of 48 untagged kelts by visual observations and
   video-monitoring at one spillway. In autumn 1993 and 1997, 62.4\% and
   44.0\% of the tagged kelts migrated downstream to the dam at water
   temperatures between 0.1 and 0.8 degrees C. During release of
   spillwater, the kelts gathered along the dam with limited movements.
   Neither smolts nor kelts used the 2 m submerged turbine shafts as a
   pathway to migrate downstream Hunderfossen dam. Nor did release of large
   amounts of deep water through spillways provide downstream migration
   possibilities for kelts and possibly for smolts. The majority of both
   smolts and kelts migrated downstream at short periods of surface water
   release through the spillways, indicating high importance of surface
   water release. The threshold value of descend of kelts at surface
   release was between 1 and 4 m(3) s(-1) which correspond to a water
   column between 12 and 36 cm. These findings are highly relevant
   regarding hydroelectric development in river systems containing
   iteroparous salmonid species.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that an estuarine
   species as the spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii is evenly
   distributed within the estuary and uniformly exploited by different
   groups of fishers. This was done by investigating the movements and area
   use of spotted grunter in relation to the fisheries. The position of 20
   acoustically tagged fish was recorded during 36 days in February and
   March 2003, by manual tracking and automated data logging receivers.
   Information on the fisheries in the estuary was collected through visual
   registration of fishing effort and interviews. The spotted grunter moved
   on average 1.0 km (SD +/- 0.7) between positional fixes. Most of the
   fish were positioned in the lower part of the 12 km long estuary, as
   70\% of the positional fixes were within the first 3 km, and 89\% within
   the first 6 km. Approximately half (49\%) of all the fixes were between
   1.0 and 1.5 km from the estuary mouth. The spotted grunter used on
   average 4.9 km (SD +/- 4.9) of the length of the estuary, and there was
   no significant relationship between the length of the estuary used and
   the body length of the fish (26-39 cm TL). Subsistence fishers accounted
   for 73\% of fishing lines in the water, while recreational fishers
   accounted for the rest. Ninety-three percent of the lines were recorded
   within the first 6 km from the estuary mouth, of which 80\% were
   recorded within the first 3 km. Almost 1/3 of the fishing effort was
   recorded between 1.0 and 1.5 km from the mouth. The hypothesis that the
   estuarine dependent species spotted grunter was evenly distributed
   within the estuary was rejected. However, there was a significant
   relationship between the distribution of the fishing effort of the
   subsistence fishers and the fish, indicating that the spotted grunter
   was uniformly exploited within the estuary by this group of fishers. In
   contrast, there was no relationship between the distribution of fish and
   recreational anglers.},

Abstract = {Effects of artificial salmon lice infection and pharmaceutical salmon
   lice prophylaxis on survival and rate of progression of Atlantic salmon
   (n = 72) and brown trout post-smolts (n = 72) during their fjord
   migration, were studied by telemetry. The infected groups were
   artificially exposed to infective salmon lice larvae in the laboratory
   immediately before release in the inner part of the fjord to simulate a
   naturally high infection pressure. Groups of infected Atlantic salmon (n
   = 20) and brown trout (n = 12) were also retained in the hatchery to
   control the infection intensity and lice development during the study
   period. Neither salmon lice infection nor pharmaceutical prophylaxis had
   any effects on survival and rate of progression of fjord migrating
   Atlantic salmon post-smolts compared to control fish. Atlantic salmon
   spent on average only 151.2 h (maximum 207.3 h) in passing the 80 km
   fjord system and had, thus, entered the ocean when the more pathogenic
   pre-adult and adult lice stages developed. The brown trout, in
   comparison to Atlantic salmon, remained to a larger extent than Atlantic
   salmon in the inner part of the fjord system. No effect of salmon lice
   infection, or protection, was found in brown trout during the first
   weeks of their fjord migration. Brown trout will, to a larger extent
   than Atlantic salmon, stay in the fjord areas when salmon lice
   infections reach the more pathogenic pre-adult and adult stages. In
   contrast to Atlantic salmon, they will thereby possess the practical
   capability of returning to freshwater when encountering severe salmon
   lice attacks.},

Abstract = {A telemetry study in a Norwegian regulated river was conducted through a
   12-day period in mid-winter 2003. The objective was to study activity
   (defined as number of movement per hour) and movement (defined as
   distance moved per hour) during different ice formation events.
   Twenty-four Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) parr were radio tagged and
   continuously monitored by both manually tracking (N = 24) and by fixed
   recording stations (N = 15). Detailed data on climate, flow and ice
   formation and its spatial distribution were collected and used in the
   analyses. Fish activity was not found to be affected by their size (L
   (F)). There was a significant difference in activity between diel
   periods with highest activity during dusk (5-6 p.m.). Between high and
   low flow (mean +/- SD, 21.1 m(3) s(-1) +/- 1.7 SD and 11.1 m(3) s(-1)
   +/- 1.7 SD, respectively) no significant difference in activity was
   found. During the experiment extensive anchor ice growth occurred mainly
   in the riffle part with thickness up to 50 cm. Juveniles tend to avoid
   riffle section during anchor ice formation and exploited ice covered
   areas, indicating critical and preferable habitats respectively.
   Further, a significant difference in movement was found between five
   selected ice events with highest mean movement during an anchor ice
   event and lowest mean movement during an ice break up with no anchor ice
   formation. No significant difference in activity or movement between
   parr exposed to frazil ice and parr not exposed were found.},

Abstract = {Ecological and economical sustainability of marine aquaculture
   operations depend on proper feeding management. Feed wastage from
   overfeeding is a source of pollution, represents futile use of precious
   marine resources, and undermines the economic viability of operations.
   Additionally, underfeeding reduces growth and fish welfare. Finding an
   optimal feeding regime in terms of temporal and spatial distribution of
   the feed ration require intimate knowledge of the individual feeding
   behaviour of fish sustaining intensive culturing conditions. Fish
   telemetry has proved to be a valuable tool for studying spatial
   behaviour in sea cages, however there are currently no practical methods
   available with respect to detection of actual feed intake in fish on the
   individual level. The present study investigates pressure transients
   arising in the opercular cavity of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar
   L.) in connection with feeding, and whether such measurements can serve
   as an indication of feed ingestion. A technical solution to the sensing
   problem based on a differential pressure transducer is presented along
   with typical pressure signal traces obtained during feeding in a hard
   wire tank experiment. Measurements showed considerable variation of
   sub-ambient pressure transients (1.5 kPa +/- 0.95) and their duration
   (519 ms +/- 117), suggesting that the fish modulates its strike
   intensity depending on the particular feeding situation. Despite
   variations in scale, opercular pressure waveforms have distinct
   structural features that repeat between feeding instants. From a signal
   processing point of view waveforms provide sufficient information with
   respect to isolation and detection of feeding incidents, which is
   important with respect to a potential implementation of the sensing
   principle in a telemetry tag design. Issues regarding development and
   application of a telemetry system based on this sensing principle are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The population concept is central in evolutionary and conservation
   biology, but identifying the boundaries of natural populations is often
   challenging. Here, we present a new approach for assessing spatial
   genetic structure without the a priori assumptions on the locations of
   populations made by adopting an individual-centred approach. Our method
   is based on assignment tests applied in a moving window over an
   extensively sampled study area. For each individual, a spatially
   explicit probability surface is constructed, showing the estimated
   probability of finding its multilocus genotype across the landscape, and
   identifying putative migrants. Population boundaries are localized by
   estimating the mean slope of these probability surfaces over all
   individuals to identify areas with genetic discontinuities. The
   significance of the genetic discontinuities is assessed by permutation
   tests. This new approach has the potential to reveal cryptic population
   structure and to improve our ability to understand gene flow dynamics
   across landscapes. We illustrate our approach by simulations and by
   analysing two empirical datasets: microsatellite data of Ursus arctos in
   Scandinavia, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data of
   Rhododendron ferrugineum in the Alps.},

Abstract = {We analysed barnacle Branta leucopsis and pink-footed goose Anser
   brachyrhynchus summer diets (May-July 2003) based on the proportions of
   different plant constituents in the faecal material of adult breeding
   birds in Sassendalen, Svalbard to assess potential inter-specific
   competition. Diets were highly restricted and overlapped little during
   pre-nesting and post hatch. During incubation both species showed
   greatest variety in their diet, reflecting site-specific differences in
   local food abundance. However, locally the diets of pink-footed and
   barnacle geese resembled each other most at this time (although still
   differing significantly). The conflicting needs of nest defence and
   maintenance of body condition constrains the extent of the feeding
   resource utilised by nesting pairs and explains slightly greater dietary
   overlap at this time. Hence, there is little evidence of inter-specific
   competition (interference or depletion) at present, but this is most
   likely to be manifest during the incubation period in the future if
   goose numbers continue to increase. More detailed investigations of the
   degree of spatial overlap of the two species and their effects on plant
   structure, quality and community composition are necessary to predict
   likely outcomes of expected increases in numbers of both goose species.},

Abstract = {Rapid growth and development are associated with several fitness-related
   benefits. Yet, organisms usually grow more slowly than their
   physiological maximum, suggesting that rapid growth may carry costs.
   Here we use coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) eggs of wild and
   transgenic genotypes to test whether rapid growth causes reduced
   tolerance to low levels of oxygen (hypoxia). Eggs were exposed to four
   different durations of hypoxia, and survival and growth were recorded
   until the end of the larval stage. Survival rates decreased with
   increasing duration of hypoxia, but this decrease was most pronounced
   for the transgenic group. Larval mass was also negatively affected by
   hypoxia; however, transgenic genotypes were significantly larger than
   wild genotypes at the end of the larval stage. Oxygen can be a limiting
   factor for survival and development in a wide range of organisms,
   particularly during the egg stage. Thus, the reduced ability of
   fast-growing genotypes to cope with low oxygen levels identified in the
   present study may represent a general constraint on evolution of rapid
   growth across taxa.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-325},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Successful plant invasions require both the founding and local spread of
   new populations. High plant densities occur only when founding plants
   are able to disperse their seeds well locally to quickly colonize and
   fill the new patch. We test this ability in a 7-year field experiment
   with Carduus acanthoides, an invasive weed in several North American
   ecosystems. Founder plants were planted in the center of 64 m(2) plots
   and we monitored the recruitment, distribution pattern, mortality, and
   seed production of the seedlings that originated from these founding
   plants. Competing vegetation was clipped not at all, once, or twice each
   year to evaluate the importance of interspecific competition. More
   seedlings recruited in the intermediate once-clipped plots, and these
   seedlings also survived better. The control plots had fewer microsites
   for seedling recruitment; clipping a second time in September stimulated
   grasses to fill up the gaps. The number of C. acanthoides recruits and
   their median distances from the founder plants were also explained by
   the initial seed production of the founding plants. Overall, the
   experiment shows that the success of founder plants can fluctuate
   strongly, as 55\% of the plots were empty by the sixth year. Our study
   suggests that the local invasion speed following initial establishment
   depends strongly on both the propagule pressure and availability of
   suitable microsites for seedling recruitment and growth.},

Abstract = {The goal of habitat selection studies is to identify important habitats
   for a particular species. However, most studies using radiotelemetry
   have focused on habitat-selection patterns using daytime positions only.
   We used 24 h data from six female brown bears (Ursus arctos L., 1758)
   equipped with GPS-GSM collars and activity loggers to analyse variations
   in habitat selection related to diel variations in activity (foraging
   and resting). We found that the bears rested mainly during the daylight
   hours and foraged mainly during the crepuscular and nocturnal hours. The
   bears selected habitats differently when they were resting than when
   they were foraging. We found no selection for tall coniferous forest
   using all data, but this habitat was selected by resting bears and
   avoided by foraging bears. Thus, for studies of habitat selection, our
   results show the importance of obtaining data from all 24 h and dividing
   these data into relevant categories based on the diel activity pattern
   of the studied species.},

Abstract = {The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) code for
   proteins involved in antigen recognition and triggering of the adaptive
   immune response, and are therefore likely to be under selection from
   parasites. These selection regimes may vary in space and time. Here we
   report a strong geographical structure in MHC class II B genes of a
   migrating bird, the great snipe (Gallinago media). Genetic
   differentiation in the MHC between two ecologically distinct
   distributional regions (Scandinavian mountain populations vs. East
   European lowland populations) was still present after statistically
   controlling for the effect of selectively neutral variation
   (microsatellites) using partial Mantel tests. This suggests a role for
   selection in generating this spatial structure and that it represents
   local adaptation to different environments. Differentiation between
   populations within the two regions was negligible. Overall, we found a
   high number of MHC alleles (50, from 175 individuals). This, together
   with a tendency for a higher rate of nonsynonymous than synonymous
   substitutions in the peptide binding sites, and high Tajima's D in
   certain regions of the gene, suggests a history of balancing selection.
   MHC variation is often thought to be maintained by some form of
   balancing selection, but the nature of this selection remains unclear.
   Our results support the hypothesis that spatial variation in selection
   regimes contributes to the high polymorphism.},

Abstract = {An understanding of how species are affected by top-down and bottom-up
   processes in food webs, and how these forces interact with climatic
   conditions is crucial for how ecosystems should be managed. In Norway
   large carnivores are effectively removed from extensive areas to protect
   livestock, leaving human harvesting as the only significant top-down
   force on ungulate populations. We examined the relative role of top-down
   and bottom-up processes for 58 semi-domesticated reindeer populations in
   Norway subjected to contrasting climatic regimes over the period
   1981-2005. Intensive herding and international agreement have resulted
   in a situation where some populations are unable to undertake seasonal
   migration to the interior to escape the unfavourable climatic conditions
   that rule the coastal region in the winter, a critical season for
   northern ungulates. We used this natural manipulation to contrast
   between populations with `poor' and `good' winter conditions. For
   populations with good winter conditions, average body size increased
   with harvesting, suggesting that some top-down process was necessary to
   avoid food limitation. Time-series analyses revealed that direct
   regulation of population size was only evident in populations subjected
   to intensive harvesting. The lack of direct regulation in populations
   subjected to low harvesting resulted in high vulnerability to harsh
   winter weather. The body size and climate vulnerability of populations
   with poor winter conditions was unaffected of harvesting, but average
   densities was positively related to overall vegetation productivity as
   indexed by satellite images (NDVI). Top-down processes appeared to be
   necessary to dampen the effect of harsh winters in populations with
   generally good winter conditions. Conversely, populations subjected to
   generally poor winter conditions appeared to be more influenced by
   bottom-up processes and buffered climatic perturbations by increasing
   body size.},

   a population of charr in the High Arctic, with samples being taken every
   5-7 weeks. The ice cover lasted for more than 9 months, from mid-October
   to late July, with the greatest thickness in mid-May. Although most
   charr occupied the littoral zone during winter, the highest densities in
   April and October were found in the deeper areas (20 m) of the lake. The
   fish fed at all times of the year, but the number of stomachs with food
   and the stomach-filling indices were lowest during the darkest part of
   the season. The diet of smaller charr (< 15 cm) varied strongly with
   season, showing a dominance of zooplankton in late autumn and
   chironomids in winter (larvae) and summer (pupae). The food choice was
   in accordance with the density of food items available. Larger fish (>=
   15 cm) were mostly cannibalistic during the entire year.},

Abstract = {The northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) is an interesting candidate for
   the study of patterns and levels of halogenated organic contaminants
   (HOCs) since they accumulate high levels of certain HOCs. In the present
   study we characterized a suite of established and novel HOCs in northern
   fulmars breeding on Bjornoya in the Norwegian Arctic. A comparison
   between blood and liver HOC levels was made, and the levels were related
   to the ratios of heavier to lighter stable isotopes of nitrogen
   N-15/N-14 (delta N-15) and carbon C-13/C-12 (delta C-13) in muscle. A
   significant difference in congener patterns between blood and liver was
   found. The delta C-13 was not related to HOCs, neither in liver nor in
   blood. Weak correlations were found between delta N-15 and liver HOC
   levels. The 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents (TEQs)
   in northern fulmars were well above thresholds for reproductive effects
   in seabirds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Volume = {146},

Abstract = {Adipose tissues from 20 arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) of both sexes from
   Svalbard were analysed for polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE),
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDE), chlordane, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations. Gender
   (0.43 < p < 0.97) and age (0.15 < p < 0.95) were not significantly
   related to any of the organohalogen groups. Body condition showed a
   significant inverse relationship with Sigma PBDE, Sigma Chlordane and
   HCB, suggesting that increased tissue contaminant concentrations are
   associated with depletion of adipose tissue. The seasonal cyclic storage
   and mobilisation of adipose tissue, characteristic in Arctic wildlife,
   may then provide increased input of contaminants to sensitive, vital
   effect organs. Trophic position was estimated by delta N-15 from muscle
   samples and showed significantly positive relationship with all
   contaminants, with the exception of HCB concentrations. This indicates
   that foxes feeding at high trophic levels had higher tissue contaminant
   levels as a result of bioaccumulation in the food chain. (c) 2006

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {In all areas where they have been studied, male roe deer are believed to
   have a territorial mating system, although few quantitative studies have
   been conducted and there remains considerable debate about the function
   of male roe deer territories. We observed 139 aggressive interactions
   between male roe deer in Storfosna Island (Norway) during one
   territorial season (March-August). We recognised seven rank levels of
   escalation according to the potential danger of the behaviour. On the
   basis of the number of escalation levels included in the interactions,
   the complexity of the fights was also scored. We recorded the presence
   of other individuals during the interaction, the age, the antler size,
   the territorial status and the residency status of the two contestants
   and tested how these variables affected escalation, complexity and
   outcome of the fights. Most of the interactions ended with low levels of
   escalation, and physical contact occurred only in fights between two
   territorial bucks. The escalation was also affected by the difference in
   antler size index (the bucks escalated more when the difference in
   antler size was smaller) and increased with an increasing number of
   female deer present during the interaction. The resident buck won in
   81\% of the fights. When it drew or lost, it was generally both inferior
   in age and antler size, and the duration and escalation of the
   interactions were higher. However, even when a fight was lost, no
   territory loss occurred. These results are consistent with the
   evolutionary game theory and the proposed low risk-low gain strategy of
   roe deer bucks.},

Abstract = {Differences in salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestation on
   sympatric populations of fiord-migrating, Atlantic salmon postsmolts
   (Salmo solar), brown trout (Salmo trutta) (sea trout), and Arctic charr
   (Solvelinus alpinus) were studied in three fjords with fish-farming
   activity in northern Norway during the period June-August 2000. Atlantic
   salmon post-smolts were only captured in the fjords during late June and
   early July, and probably left them subsequently. No fish were infested
   with salmon lice. In contrast, brown trout and Arctic charr had similar
   infection patterns during their sampling periods, with very low
   prevalence and mean infection intensity during June (0-21\% and 0-6 lice
   per fish, respectively), slightly increasing in July (8-70\% and 6-12
   lice per fish, respectively), and peaking in August (80-88\% and 19-27
   lice per fish, respectively). The chalimus stages dominated during June
   and July, with a few preadult and adult stages observed in July, and all
   stages were found frequently during August. The observations indicate
   that Atlantic salmon may have a mismatch between the time of louse
   infestation and their post-smolt fjord migration in northern fjords. In
   contrast, brown trout and Arctic charr feed within the fjords throughout
   summer and have a higher risk of harmful infestation in years with
   suitable environmental conditions for salmon louse development,
   especially in fish-farming areas. Arctic charr usually spend the
   shortest time at sea of the three species, and the salmon lice may not
   have time to develop to the adult stage on this species.},

   two Scandinavian brown bear populations, using molecular techniques to
   determine paternity.
   2. We found a significant difference in male YRS between the study
   areas, with lower YRS in the south than in the north.
   3. In general, older and larger males had higher YRS. Older males may be
   more experienced in competition for reproduction (male dominance). Large
   body size is of direct benefit in male-male competition and of advantage
   in endurance competition for the access to females.
   4. Age was relatively more important for YRS in the north and body size
   was more important in the south, due perhaps to differences in male age
   structure due to illegal killing. A single old male dominated the
   reproduction in the north during the study, which resulted most probably
   in the relatively higher importance of age in the north. In the south,
   with a more even male age structure, no single male was able to
   dominate, probably resulting in a more intense competition among males,
   with body size as the deciding factor.
   5. Male YRS was correlated positively with population density. This may
   be related to the structure of the expanding bear population, with
   female densities declining towards the population edge.
   6. Internal relatedness, a measure of genetic heterozygosity, was
   correlated negatively with YRS, suggesting that outbred individuals have
   a higher YRS. Individual heterozygosity at key or many loci may reflect
   male physical qualities and condition-sensitive traits, which may
   benefit males directly in contest or in sperm competition.},

Title = {Temporal variability in marine feeding of sympatric Arctic charr and sea
   trout},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The marine feeding pattern of anadromous brown trout (sea trout) Salmo
   trutta and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus was studied during June to
   August in 1992-1993 and 2000-2004 in a fjord in northern Norway. In
   general sea trout fed proportionally more on fishes than on crustaceans
   and insects (81, 1 and 18\% by mass, respectively) by comparison with
   Arctic charr (52, 25 and 22\% by mass, respectively). Herring Clupea
   harengus dominated the total fish diet of both species, but the Arctic
   charr also fed significantly on gadoids and sandlance Ammodytes spp.
   While sea trout became virtually all piscivorous at fork lengths (L-F)
   >= 250 mm, the Arctic charr was >= 400 mm L-F before shifting totally to
   a fish diet. Despite annual variation in diet and forage ratios, there
   was a clear shift in diet from 1992-1993 to 2000-2004. Sandlance and
   different crustaceans constituted most of the diet during the initial
   period with a shift towards gadoids and especially herring during the
   latter period. This shift seemed to be associated with a high abundance
   of herring larvae during the latter sampling period, indicating a
   preferential selection on herring when present, particularly by sea
   trout. Furthermore, an index indicated dietary overlap in years with
   intensive feeding on herring of both species, and usually differences in
   the trophic ecology during years feeding mostly on other prey species.
   In combination, it was hypothesized that the two species reflect the
   type of marine prey present within a fjord system over time, and
   therefore provide an index of variation in the production and biological
   diversity of their potential prey within fjords. (c)) 2007 The Authors.

Title = {Escaping parasitism in the selfish herd: age, size and density-dependent
   warble fly infestation in reindeer},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {116},
Number = {3},
Pages = {491-499},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It has been suggested that animals may escape attack from mobile
   parasites by aggregating in selfish herds. A selfish herd disperses the
   risk of being attacked among its members and the per individual risk of
   parasite infection should therefore decrease with increasing animal
   density through the encounter-dilution effect. Moreover, in a selfish
   herd, dominant and agile animals should occupy the best positions and
   thereby receive fewer attacks compared to lower ranked animals at the
   periphery. We tested these predictions on reindeer (Rangifer tarandus
   tarandus) parasitized by warble flies (Hypoderma tarandi). Warble flies
   oviposit their eggs on reindeer during summer and induce strong
   anti-parasitic behavioural responses in the herds. In this period,
   reindeer are sexually segregated; females and calves form large and
   dense herds while males are more solitary. After hatching, the warble
   fly larvae migrate under the skin of their host where they encyst. In
   the present study encysted larvae were counted on newly slaughtered
   hides of male calves and 1.5 year old males from 18 different reindeer
   herds in Finnmark, northern Norway with large contrasts in reindeer
   density. In reindeer, body mass is correlated with fitness and social
   status and we hypothesized that individual carcass mass reflected the
   animal's ability to occupy the best positions within the herd. Larval
   abundance was higher among the 1.5 year old males than among the calves.
   For calves we found in accordance with the selfish herd hypothesis a
   negative relationship between larval abundance and animal density and
   between larval abundance and body mass. These relationships were absent
   for the 1.5 year old males. We suggest that these differences were due
   to different grouping behaviour where calves and females, but not males,
   aggregated in selfish herds where they escaped parasitism.},

Abstract = {Similarity measures are among the most intuitive and common measures for
   comparing two or more sites, or samples, with respect to their species
   overlap. A restriction of similarity measures is that they are limited
   to pairwise comparisons even in a multiple-site study. This work
   presents a multiple-site similarity measure that makes use of
   information on species shared by more than two sites and avoids the
   problem of covariance between pairwise similarities in a multiple-site
   study. Further, we show that our multiple-site similarity measure is
   related to beta-diversity measures such as Whittaker's beta-diversity.
   Similarity measures can also be used as descriptors of effective
   specialization of insects to host species by measuring similarity from
   host observations. Finally, we show that multiple-site similarity and
   host specificity are two sides of the same coin.},

Title = {Effects of a power line on migration and range use of wild reindeer},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {134},
Number = {4},
Pages = {484-494},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Linear infrastructures such as roads, pipelines and power lines can
   hinder Rangifer migration and reduce the total amount of area available
   for foraging. We studied the barrier and aversion effect of a 66 kV
   power line transecting the range of wild reindeer in North Ottadalen,
   south central Norway using aerial surveys of reindeer distribution
   (direct measurement of reindeer use) and lichen measurements (indirect
   measurement of reindeer use) at varying distances from both sides of the
   power line. We present a clear definition of the expected barrier and
   aversion effects, and present specific hypotheses and predictions based
   on these two terms that are often used unclearly in the literature. The
   aerial surveys and ground observations showed that reindeer crossed
   underneath and grazed under and on both sides of the power line during
   14 out of the 22 years (63.6\%) surveys were conducted over the last 31
   years. This behaviour was confirmed by the lichen measurements,
   indicating a higher use of lichen pastures along ridges close to and
   under the power line compared to those at increasing distances and up to
   3 km from both sides of the power line. This winter grazing pattern
   probably reflects the topographical channeling of reindeer to the ridges
   along an 8 km wide topographical corridor encompassing the power line
   and cannot be attributed to the power line itself. We found that direct
   measurement data (visual observations such as ours or GPS/telemetry
   tracking) provide less ambiguous information for testing barrier and
   aversion effects than indirect measurement data (pasture/ lichen
   measurements) that are likely influenced by numerous uncontrollable
   environmental variables independent of reindeer grazing. Our results
   contrast with recent studies indicating strong barrier and aversion
   effects of similar power lines for Rangifer migration and grazing
   behaviour in alpine terrain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Genetic tracking of the brown bear in northern Pakistan and implications
   for conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {134},

Abstract = {Asian bears face major threats due to the impact of human activities as
   well as a critical lack of knowledge about their status, distribution
   and needs for survival. Once abundant in northern Pakistan, the
   Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has been exterminated in
   most of its former distribution range. It presently occurs sparsely, in
   small populations, the Deosai National Park supporting the largest
   isolate. This decline might imply a reduction in genetic diversity,
   compromising the survival of the population. Using a combination of
   fecal DNA analysis and field data, our study aimed at assessing the size
   and genetic status of the Deosai population and give guidelines for its
   conservation and management. Using fecal genetic analysis, we estimated
   the population to be 40-50 bears, which compares well with the field
   census of 38 bears. The northern Pakistani brown bear population may
   have undergone an approximate 200-300-fold decrease during the last
   thousand years, probably due to glaciations and the influence of growing
   human population. However, in spite of the presence of a bottleneck
   genetic signature, the Deosai population has a moderate level of genetic
   diversity and is not at immediate risk of inbreeding depression. Gene
   flow might exist with adjacent populations. We recommend careful
   monitoring of this population in the future both with field observations
   and genetic analyses, including sampling of adjacent populations to
   assess incoming gene flow. The connectivity with adjacent populations in
   Pakistan and India will be of prime importance for the longterm survival
   of Deosai bears. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Plant trait responses to grazing - a global synthesis},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Herbivory by domestic and wild ungulates is a major driver of global
   vegetation dynamics. However, grazing is not considered in dynamic
   global vegetation models, or more generally in studies of the effects of
   environmental change on ecosystems at regional to global scale. An
   obstacle to this is a lack of empirical tests of several hypotheses
   linking plant traits with grazing. We, therefore, set out to test
   whether some widely recognized trait responses to grazing are consistent
   at the global level. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant trait
   responses to grazing, based on 197 studies from all major regions of the
   world, and using six major conceptual models of trait response to
   grazing as a framework. Data were available for seven plant traits: life
   history, canopy height, habit, architecture, growth form (forb,
   graminoid, herbaceous legume, woody), palatability, and geographic
   origin. Covariates were precipitation and evolutionary history of
   herbivory. Overall, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, short
   plants over tall plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous
   and rosette architecture over tussock architecture. There was no
   consistent effect of grazing on growth form. Some response patterns were
   modified by particular combinations of precipitation and history of
   herbivory. Climatic and historical contexts are therefore essential for
   understanding plant trait responses to grazing. Our study identifies
   some key traits to be incorporated into plant functional classifications
   for the explicit consideration of grazing into global vegetation models
   used in global change research. Importantly, our results suggest that
   plant functional type classifications and response rules need to be
   specific to regions with different climate and herbivory history.},

Abstract = {We tested the theories on hierarchical foraging by large herbivores by
   studying selection of woody browse by goats in a semi-arid savanna. In
   the smallest scale, we compared characteristics of woody plants browsed
   by observed goats with those of all woody plants available for the goats
   along their feeding paths. Particularly we recorded food selection in
   relation to plant species, height, canopy cover and previous browsing.
   In an intermediate scale we compared vegetation characteristics along
   the paths walked by foraging goats with characteristics of the
   vegetation available within the feeding site. In the largest scale we
   compared characteristics of vegetation within the feeding sites with
   those from the whole landscape. Goat selection was consistent across all
   scales, and the frequency of the most preferred tree species increased
   with decreasing scale from landscape to feeding site to feeding path to
   diet. Within browse species, goats preferred to browse from relatively
   high trees and from trees with signs of previous browsing. Preference
   for browse species could not be well explained by intake rate of
   nutrients or biomass but may be negatively related to intake rate of
   digestibility reducing compounds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Natural and man-made organobromine compounds in marine biota from
   Central Norway},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Brominated organic pollutants were found in selected samples of mollusk
   tissue, fish liver, as well as in the eggs and livers of shag from three
   sites in Central Norway. More than 80 organobromines were identified
   owing to the defined isotope ratio acquired by GC/ECNI-MS. However, only
   a few peaks could be assigned to anthropogenic brominated flame
   retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Most of the organobromine
   compounds detected were unknown or halogenated natural products. The
   known halogenated natural products MHC-1 and TBA were abundant in all
   samples and usually between equally abundant, and up to 50 fold more
   concentrated than the major polybrominated diphenyl ether congener BDE
   47. The halogenated natural products BC-2 (2-MeO-BDE 68) and BC-3
   (6'-MeO-BDE 47), were on level with BDE 100 which was the second most
   abundant BDE congener in many samples. The previously identified natural
   polybrominated hexahydroxanthene derivatives (PBHDs) were detected for
   the first time in bird eggs. Being major contaminants in bird eggs,
   PBHDs were only present at low levels in bird liver from nestlings
   originating from the same clutch. Such differences were detected for
   several other major contaminants. One unknown tetrabromo compound
   particularly abundant in mussels from Munkholmen was studied by GC/MS
   and the molecular ion was detected at m/z 446. The abundance of the most
   important unknown compounds did not correlate with BDEs and they most
   likely represent halogenated natural products. This study supports that
   halogenated natural products have to be treated as serious contaminants
   of marine coastal waters. Our data suggest that their abundance is
   highest in habitats along the shoreline. Thorough examination of these
   compounds in environmental samples is an important task. (c) 2006

Title = {Of chickens and eggs: Diverging propagule size of iteroparous and
   semelparous organisms},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {232-238},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Interactive effects of two or more life-history traits on fitness have
   the potential to create suites of coadapted traits. Propagule (egg or
   seed) size is one such trait that is believed to have undergone
   coadaptation with other traits. Phylogenetic analyses of salmonid fishes
   have revealed an association between large eggs and semelparity, leading
   to the question of which came first. It has been hypothesized that an
   increased egg size would have increased juvenile relative to adult
   survival, favoring a subsequent increase in reproductive effort and
   eventually semelparity. Others have suggested that this is insufficient
   to cause a shift in parity, implying to the contrary that semelparity
   gave rise to larger eggs. In a previous study we showed that
   environmental unpredictability might select for production of larger
   propagules. Here we use simulations to directly model how propagule size
   evolves in response to environmental unpredictability with varying
   degrees of iteroparity. Our results demonstrate that environmental
   unpredictability causes pronounced propagule size divergence between
   iteroparous and purely semelparous species in taxa with a fixed age at
   maturity (e.g., pure annual species). However, even rare incidents of
   repeat breeding are sufficient to reduce selection for larger propagules
   substantially and thus divergence. Furthermore, introducing variation in
   age at maturity within propagule size genotypes has evolutionary effects
   similar to that of repeat breeding. Environmental unpredictability is
   thus unlikely to provide a general alternative explanation for the
   observed egg size divergence between iteroparous and semelparous
   salmonids.},

Title = {The marine temperature and depth preferences of Arctic charr (Salvelinus
   alpinus) and sea trout (Salmo trutta), as recorded by data storage tags},
Journal = {FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {436-447},
Abstract = {Eleven Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) (370-512 mm) and eight sea
   trout (Salmo trutta) (370-585 mm in length) were tagged externally or
   internally with depth- and temperature-measuring data-storage tags (DST)
   before they were released into the sea in the Alta Fjord in north Norway
   in June 2002. All sea trout were recaptured after they spent 1-40 days
   at sea, while all Arctic charr were recaptured after 0.5-33 days at sea.
   On average, trout preferred water about 0.6 m deeper and 1.3 degrees C
   warmer than Arctic charr. Arctic charr spent > 50\% of their time
   between 0 and 1 m depth, while trout spent > 50\% of their time between
   1 and 2 m depth. Both species spent > 90\% of their time in water no
   deeper than 3 m from the water surface. However, sea trout dove more
   frequently and to greater depths (max. 28 m) than Arctic charr (max. 16
   m), and these deep dives were most frequently performed at the end of
   the sea migration. Arctic charr demonstrated a diel diving pattern,
   staying on average about 0.5 m deeper between 08:00 hours and about
   15:00 hours than during the rest of the 24 h, even though there was
   continuous daylight during the experiments. When comparing data obtained
   from the DSTs with temperature measurements within the fjord system, the
   two species were observed to select different feeding areas during their
   sea migration, the sea trout choosing the inner and warmer parts of the
   fjord, in contrast to the Arctic charr that preferred the outer, colder
   parts of the fjord. The observed differences in migration behaviour
   between the two species are discussed in relation to species preferences
   for prey and habitat selection, and their optimal temperatures for
   growth.},

Title = {Is the shape of the density-growth relationship for stream salmonids
   evidence for exploitative rather than interference competition?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {76},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-138},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Empirical studies show that average growth of stream-dwelling salmon and
   trout often declines with increasing density in a characteristic concave
   relationship. However, the mechanisms that generate negative
   density-growth relationships in populations in natural streams are not
   certain.
   In a recent study, Imre, Grant \& Cunjak (2005; Journal of Animal
   Ecology, 74, 508-516) argue that density-dependent growth due to
   exploitative competition for prey causes the negative density-growth
   relationships for stream salmonids. They argue that the concave shape of
   empirical density-growth relationships is consistent with a simple model
   of exploitative competition and not consistent with interference
   competition for space.
   We use a simple model to show that competition for space can yield
   concave density-growth relationships consistent with the empirical
   pattern when individuals compete for foraging sites that vary spatially
   in quality and lower-quality sites predominate. Thus, the predictions of
   the exploitative competition and spatial competition models overlap.
   The shape of the density-growth relationship does not differentiate
   between candidate mechanisms underlying density-dependent growth for
   stream salmonids. Our results highlight the general problem with
   determining the mechanism driving an ecological process from patterns in
   observational data within the context of linking population demographics
   to habitat structure and animal behaviour.},

   distribution and surface properties respectively. The study confirms the
   influence of the fillers on the optical paper properties. Increasing the
   amount of fillers in the surface layers reduces the surface
   micro-roughness and increases the glossy appearance of paper. The
   surface topography affecting the missing dots occurrence seems to be
   revealed by a quadtree decomposition approach and by bandpass-filtering,
   for assessing specific structure sizes of the surfaces. This approach
   reveals the influence of the surface structure between 80 and 160 mu m
   for inducing missing dots.},

Pages = {112-118},
Abstract = {To assess the importance of semi-domesticated reindeer Rangifer tarandus
   calves in the diet of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos, in Finnmark
   (northern Norway), we collected prey remains at 37 nests over six years
   (2001-2006). The study area was divided into 1) a fjord area, which is
   an important calving area for reindeer, and 2) an inland area where few
   reindeer give birth. 469 prey items were collected over the years. The
   diet of eagles was numerically dominated by birds (73\% of collected
   prey items), especially willow/rock ptarmigan Lagopus spp. (51\%), while
   mammals made up 27\%, with mountain hare Lepus timidus as the most
   common species. Remains of reindeer calves were found in half of the
   nests studied and made up 8.5\% of the collected prey items: 13.2\% in
   the fjord area and 6.5\% in the inland area. There was a higher chance
   of finding reindeer calves at nests in the fjord area than inland, and
   in nests situated in birch forest than in pine forest. The number of
   reindeer calves in the Golden Eagle diet in Finnmark corroborates well
   other studies from northern Fermoscandia. The importance of the Golden
   Eagle as a predator on reindeer can't, however, be assessed here.},

Title = {Influence of local illumination and plant composition on the spatial and

   rainforest},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Using pitfall traps, we evaluated the spatial and seasonal variance in
   arthropod abundance, species richness, higher taxonomic and species
   composition, and guild structure within the ground litter of seven sites
   in a relatively undisturbed rainforest in Panama. We examined each of
   these five arthropod-dependent variables at two spatial scales (a few
   meters and a few hundred meters) and one temporal scale (a few months
   encompassing dry and wet periods), against environmental variables
   including local illumination and plant composition. Trap catches (9458
   arthropods collected during 630 trap-days) were high compared to similar
   studies in temperate forests. We observed spatial and seasonal
   differences in abundance, species richness and composition of
   litter-dwelling arthropods. Often these differences appeared weakly
   related to geographical coordinates. They reflected forest structure
   (basal area) and local plant composition, and less so illumination
   patterns or seasonal changes in radiation. Seasonal variance was high
   and may relate to surrogate variables accounting for seasonal changes in
   litter moisture. The composition of higher taxa and species was often
   predicted by different independent variables at the three scales
   studied. Guild structure was difficult to predict. Our study lead us to
   expect that litter-dwelling arthropods may be more seasonal than soil
   microarthropods in tropical rainforests; and that tropical
   litter-dwelling arthropods may also be more spatially variable and
   seasonal than their temperate counterparts. We also recommend that
   conservation studies using pitfall traps in tropical rainforests should
   focus on: (1) taxonomic resolution to understand the functional
   complexity of soil organisms; (2) spatial replication to address subtle
   changes in plant composition throughout the study area; and (3) seasonal
   replicates to be commensurate with seasonal changes in litter moisture.

Abstract = {Most research on catch-and-release (C\&R) in recreational fishing has
   been conducted from a disciplinary angle focusing on the biological
   sciences and the study of hooking mortality after release. This hampers
   understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of C\&R. In the
   present synopsis, we develop an integrative perspective on C\&R by
   drawing on historical, philosophical, socio-psychological, biological,
   and managerial insights and perspectives. Such a perspective is helpful
   for a variety of reasons, such as 1) improving the science supporting
   successful fisheries management and canservation, 2) facilitating
   dialogue between managers, anglers, and other stakeholders, 3)
   minimizing conflict potentials, and 4) paving the path toward
   sustainable recreational fisheries management. The present work
   highlights the array of cultural, institutional, psychological, and
   biological factors and dimensions involved in C\&R. Progress toward
   successful treatment of C\&R might be enhanced by acknowledging the
   complexity inherent in C\&R recreational fishing.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the wolverine Gulo gulo mating system is limited. In this
   study, we use 20 microsatellite loci for paternity testing in 145
   wolverine offspring with known mothers. Samples were collected during >
   10 years in two Scandinavian populations, mainly in connection with
   radio-telemetry studies and as part of long-term population monitoring.
   In total, 51\% of the offspring were assigned a father. Our results
   demonstrate that the wolverine exhibits a polygamous mating system as
   some males were shown to produce offspring with more than one female in
   a single year. Females often reproduced with the same male in subsequent
   breeding years, but sometimes changed their partner, potentially as a
   consequence of a change in the territory-holding male in the area. In
   the majority of litters, siblings were unambiguously assigned the same
   father, indicating that multiple paternity is rare. Of 23 breeding
   pairs, for which telemetry data were available, 20 had overlapping home
   ranges, suggesting that pair formation generally is consistent with the
   territories held by wolverine males and females.},

Abstract = {A feeding trial was carried out on two captive wolverines Gulo gulo to
   evaluate methods to assess wolverine diets through scat content. During
   the feeding trial, wolverines were offered known quantities of five prey
   species. All scats were collected and their contents analysed. We
   evaluated four widely used methods of quantifying dietary composition:
   dry weight, index of relative contribution, frequency of occurrence, and
   percentage of occurrence. Based on the outcome of this evaluation,
   percentage of occurrence was found to be the most appropriate method for
   wolverine diet studies given the extreme variation in prey items (e.g.
   prey type and age) and undigested items (e.g. hide and bones) in the
   wolverine's diet. Dry weight may provide additional information on the
   amount of biomass consumed, which is biologically more meaningful than
   just the composition assessment derived from using the percentage of
   occurrence.},

   Salix spp. and birch Betula utilis, and 40\% were at the base of
   coniferous trees. The Chinese grouse favoured northern and eastern
   slopes with steepness of 0-45 degrees, averaging 15.5 +/- 11.2
   degrees(SE; N = 97); 88\% of nest sites were on slopes of < 30 degrees.
   The average cover around the nest was 50.8 +/- 20.3\% (SE; N = 86). The
   degree to which the female was covered at successful nests was 51.4 +/-
   19.9\%(SE;N= 45), which was not different from that of unsuccessful
   nests (43.1 +/- 19. 1 \% (SE); N = 17). Chinese grouse preferred to nest
   in coniferous and coniferousdeciduous mixed forests at sites with fewer
   trees and denser shrubs, compared with the available vegetation. Females
   nested on average 154.2 +/- 109.0 in (SE; N = 19) from the previous
   year's nest. Compared with the hazel grouse B. bonasia, the Chinese
   grouse showed a greater preference for nesting at the base of trees or

   puffin (Fratercula arctica L.) at Rost, northern Norway, was used to
   explore any indirect effects of climatic variations on chick production.
   By fitting statistical models on the duration of the nestling period, we
   found that it may be estimated using the average sea temperature and
   salinity at 0-20 m depth in March (having a positive and a negative
   effect, respectively). We propose that when the phyto-plankton bloom
   occurs in early spring, adverse oceanographic conditions, i.e. low
   temperature and high salinity in March, have a negative effect on puffin
   reproduction by degradation of the prey availability (mainly Clupea
   harengus) for chick-feeding adults three months later.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the detrimental effects of anthropogenic
   pollutants may be worse if organisms are exposed to natural stress. In
   this study, we examined whether negative effects of organochlorines
   (OCs) could be influenced by parasites. In two breeding seasons, we
   administered an anti-helminthic drug to groups of breeding glaucous
   gulls (Larus hyperboreus), whereas control groups were placebo treated.
   In all birds, blood residues of the most important OCs in the study
   population (hexachlorobenzene, oxychlordane,
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and polychlorinated biphenyl),
   were measured. The relationships between OCs and fitness components
   (i.e. nesting success and return rate between breeding seasons) were
   then compared between the birds receiving anti-parasite treatment and
   the controls. Among untreated males, higher blood residues of OCs were
   associated with lowered nesting success, while in males receiving
   anti-parasite treatment, there was no detrimental effect of OCs on
   fitness. Return rate was not affected by treatment or OCs. Our findings
   suggest that parasites may be an important factor in triggering
   reproductive effects of such pollutants, and that relatively low levels
   of OCs may have serious reproductive consequences in natural populations
   when stress from other sources is high.},

Title = {Selection for Heterozygosity Gives Hope to a Wild Population of Inbred
   Wolves},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Recent analyses have questioned the usefulness of heterozygosity
   estimates as measures of the inbreeding coefficient (f), a finding that
   may have dramatic consequences for the management of endangered
   populations. We confirm that f and heterozygosity is poorly correlated
   in a wild and highly inbred wolf population. Yet, our data show that for
   each level of f, it was the most heterozygous wolves that established
   themselves as breeders, a selection process that seems to have
   decelerated the loss of heterozygosity in the population despite a
   steady increase of f. The markers contributing to the positive
   relationship between heterozygosity and breeding success were found to
   be located on different chromosomes, but there was a substantial amount
   of linkage disequilibrium in the population, indicating that the markers
   are reflecting heterozygosity over relatively wide genomic regions.
   Following our results we recommend that management programs of
   endangered populations include estimates of both f and heterozygosity,
   as they may contribute with complementary information about population
   viability.},

Title = {Animal preferences and acceptability of wildlife management actions

Abstract = {Wildlife management policies are often based on expert perceptions of
   the ecological importance of certain species and poorly informed
   perceptions of how public attitudes toward management are formed. Little
   is known about why preferences vary greatly and how this affects support
   for management actions. This paper explores preferences for a range of
   wildlife species among a sample of the rural population adjacent to
   Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. We also examine the degree of
   acceptance for alternative management interventions when potentially
   dangerous animals pose different levels of problems to human beings, and
   the extent to which these attitudes are related to species preferences.
   Gender has a significant effect on species preferences. Men like most
   species better than women. Age has no significant effect, but level of
   education affects preference level for some species. Species preferences
   have a positive effect on support for management intervention when
   dangerous animals cause small or moderate problems to humans, i.e. there
   is a higher degree of acceptance of problems caused by animals that are
   well liked. In situations where human life is threatened, species
   preferences have no effect on preferred management actions. Appreciation
   of animals is a combination of functional, consumptive and cultural
   dimensions, and there is no simple link between species preferences and
   attitudes toward management actions. The local context and concrete
   experience with wildlife encounters is more important for shaping
   normative beliefs like attitudes towards management actions than global
   wildlife attitudes.},

Abstract = {For wild, sea-run brown trout (Salmo trutta) smolts, the physiological
   consequences of abrupt transfer to seawater and simultaneous challenge
   with copepodid larvae of the sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer,
   1837), were investigated in the laboratory. Analysis of osmoregulatory,
   metabolic, and stress markers allowed the derivation of a sublethal
   threshold burden of L. salmonis, above which the host suffers major
   physiological stress. Noticeable lice effects, consistent across all
   measured markers, were not observed until L. salmonis developed to the
   mobile preadult and adult stages. Preadult L. salmonis caused
   significant increases in plasma chloride, osmolality, glucose, lactate,
   and cortisol and a significant reduction in haematocrit. Piecewise
   linear statistical approaches allowed the determination of abrupt
   changes in these physiological markers, attributable to the intensity of
   L. salmonis infestation on individual fish, and identification of
   overall threshold lice burdens. Thirteen mobile lice center dot fish(-1)
   (weight range 19-70 g) was a consistent breakpoint across several
   physiological measures. This information will provide a valuable,
   objectively derived tool to aid in the formulation of effective wild
   fisheries management policy concerning S. trutta conservation.},

Abstract = {Sea trout (Salmo trutta) originating from small coastal streams can be
   found at sea throughout the year, in contrast to conspecifics from
   larger rivers, which typically spend the autumn and winter in fresh
   water. Such an extended marine stay has been observed in coastal
   Skagerrak. We studied the seasonal variation in marine growth of
   Skagerrak sea trout based on scale increment patterns and body lengths
   of 563 individuals captured at sea. Growth, measured as increased body
   length, was rapid during summer while there was no evidence for
   continued growth during autumn and winter. Growth decreased with
   increasing age of the fish. Our results suggest that coastal Skagerrak
   is an important feeding area for sea trout during summer, and that an
   extended marine stay during autumn and winter may have trade-off
   benefits other than somatic growth. Alternative benefits might be
   increased winter survival and decreased migratory costs of juvenile
   fish.},

Title = {Lipid class content as an indicator of critical periods for survival in

Year = {2006},
Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The seasonal variation in lipid class composition (triacylglycerols,
   free fatty acids, cholesterols and polar lipids) was described for
   juvenile Atlantic salmon sampled at 12 occasions over an 18-month period
   in the Norwegian River Alta (70 degrees N). Lipid class composition was
   determined for pooled samples of groups of fish sorted by cohort and
   condition factor. Mass-specific lipid content ranged from 2.3\% and
   8.1\% of fresh mass, and mass-specific triacylglycerol content between
   0.16\% and 5.6\% of fresh mass. Total lipid content decreased by 34-57\%
   during the winter period, before increasing by 155-176\% between May and
   July. A large proportion of the variation in total lipid content was due
   to variation in triacylglycerol content (r(2) = 0.95), except for
   variations at low total lipids levels when triacylglycerols were absent.
   The temporal variation in polar lipid content was, although to a lesser
   degree, related to total lipid content (r(2) = 0.62), indicating that
   the fish also utilised polar lipids as an energy source during periods
   of starvation. Analyses of 39 individual parr collected in May showed a
   large individual variation in lipid class composition in the most
   critical period of the year. It is concluded that information on
   variation in lipid class composition may give more precise and detailed
   information of energy status during critical periods, although total
   lipid content will in most cases give a fair description of the energy
   status of the fish.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine (OC) residues were measured in eggs and blood of
   different subspecies of the lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus, on
   the Norwegian coast: a) increasing L. f. intermedius in the North Sea;
   b) endangered L. f. fuscus near the Arctic Circle; c) L. f. fuscus and
   greyish-mantled gulls, with a L. f intermedius appearance, in the
   Barents Sea region. The dominating OCs in lesser black-backed gulls were
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). DDE and
   beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) residues were higher in L. f.
   fuscus compared to L. f intermedius and greyish-mantled birds in the
   Barents Sea region. In the latter area, blood residues of PCB and DDE in
   lesser black-backed gulls were as high as in great black-backed gulls,
   Larus marinus, while in the other regions they were lower. The higher
   DDE residues in endangered L. f. fuscus compared to increasing L. f
   intermedius and greyish-mantled birds, which are invading northern
   Norway, suggest that OCs may have played a role in the population
   decline of L. f.fuscus, possibly in combination with nutrient stress.

Abstract = {The year-round food habits of lynx were studied using radio-telemetry
   and snow-tracking in the boreal forest of southeastern Norway. The main
   objectives of the study were to clarify the importance of domestic sheep
   and small prey species in the diet of lynx in an area with a very low
   density of roe deer. During the period 1995-1999, we found 193 scats and
   358 kills made by lynx. Our results indicate that roe deer were the most
   common prey species (contributing to 83 and 34\% of the biomass consumed
   in winter and summer, respectively), although a wide range of other
   species were also found, including mountain hares, tetranoids, red
   foxes, domestic sheep, wild reindeer, and even moose. Most of the diet
   was obtained by predation, although we did document several cases of
   scavenging. Roe deer were more important in the diet in winter than in
   summer, perhaps because they were easier to locate in winter as they
   clustered around feeding sites. In summer, domestic sheep and small prey
   increased in importance. Despite the very low density of roe deer in
   this study area, lynx seemed to still specialise on them, although
   domestic sheep did constitute a significant amount to their diet,
   especially for males and yearlings. However, the contribution of sheep
   to summer diet was far from that expected if their relative density was
   considered.},

Title = {Glacial survival or late glacial colonization? Phylogeography of the
   root vole (Microtus oeconomus) in north-west Norway},

Abstract = {Aim It has been proposed that the root vole subspecies, Microtus
   oeconomus finmarchicus, survived the last glacial period on islands on
   the north-west coast of Norway. The Norwegian island of Andoya may have
   constituted the only site with permanent ice-free conditions. Geological
   surveys and fossil finds from Andoya demonstrate that survival
   throughout the last glacial maximum was probably possible for some
   plants and animals. In this study we aim to infer the recent
   evolutionary history of Norwegian root vole populations and to evaluate
   the glacial survival hypothesis.
   Methods DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
   was studied in 46 root voles from 19 localities.
   Location Northern Fennoscandia and north-west Russia with a focus on
   islands on the north-west coast of Norway.
   Results The phylogeographical analyses revealed two North European
   phylogroups labelled `Andoya' and `Fennoscandia'. The Andoya phylogroup
   contained root voles from the Norwegian islands of Andoya, Ringvassoya
   and Reinoya and two localities in north-west Russia. The Fennoscandian
   phylogroup encompassed root voles from the three Norwegian islands of
   Kvaloya, Hakoya and Arnoya and the remaining specimens from Norway,
   northern Sweden and Finland. Nucleotide diversity within the Andoya and
   Fennoscandian phylogroups was similar, ranging from 0.5\% to 0.7\%.
   Main conclusions Both our genetic data and previously published
   morphological data are consistent with in situ glacial survival of root
   voles on Andoya during the last glacial maximum. However, the level of
   genetic diversity observed in the extant island populations, the past
   periods of severe climatic conditions on Andoya and the ecology of the
   root vole are somewhat difficult to reconcile with this model. A
   biogeographical scenario involving late glacial recolonization along the
   northern coasts of Russia and Norway therefore represents a viable
   alternative. Our results demonstrate that complex recolonization and
   extinction histories can generate intricate phylogeographical patterns
   and relatively high levels of genetic variation in northern populations.},

Abstract = {The reappearance of wolves has led to conflicts in many rural areas.
   This paper focuses on South-Eastern Norway and the French Alps, where
   the conflict patterns are similar. Diverging interpretations of the
   situation are supported by narratives that are shared to varying degrees
   among those who occupy different positions within what we might term the
   << wolf field >>). Among these narratives there are two varieties in
   both Norway and France that catch the eye and that appear to have become
   increasingly significant as elements in the discourse on wolf
   reappearance. Rumours about the secret reintroduction of wolves by the
   authorities are common among wolf adversaries. Another narrative,
   important to the pro-wolf camp, is based on the notion that local
   opposition to the wolf presence is unique to either Norway or France.
   Yet, while the reintroduction-conspiracy rumours are frequently
   ridiculed, the notions of unique national conflict patterns have
   achieved a status almost of official truth. We suggest that this
   difference of treatment can be analyzed as a manifestation of eco-power.},

Abstract = {A circumpolar survey of heavy metals in willow ptarmigan liver and
   kidney revealed considerable variations in Cd content in Canada and
   Scandinavia. The Cd content in central Canada was comparable with that
   in Scandinavia and Russia, at least for kidney. However, in both liver
   and kidney the median for Canada as a whole was much higher than in the
   other countries. Some Canadian locations had exceptionally high levels,
   several birds having > 50 mg kg(-1) in liver and > 400 mg kg(-1) in
   kidney. In Norway, the Cd content was highest in central mountain areas
   in south Norway and inland locations in the two northernmost counties.
   Five locations in central and north Norway showed mean Cd levels in
   kidney above 100 mg kg(-1). It is difficult to evaluate regional
   differences in Sweden, but most locations had the same Cd level as
   moderately contaminated locations in Norway. Cd levels in Russia were
   comparable to moderately contaminated locations in the other countries.
   Due to a high intake of willow, naturally rich in Cd, direct comparison
   of the Cd level in willow ptarmigan from different locations cannot
   reveal the effects of long-range pollution.
   The Pb concentration in willow ptarmigan kidney and liver varied
   significantly in Norway and Canada, but not in Sweden and Russia. Levels
   in Sweden and Russia were comparable to those in Canada and low levels
   in Norway. The highest median value from all locations within countries
   was found in Norway, both in liver and kidney. The highest Pb content
   was found in south Norway, indicating an effect of long-range pollution
   in willow ptarmigan. The level in western Canada was significantly
   higher than in central Canada.
   The Hg content in liver varied significantly from one location to
   another in all the countries and in kidney everywhere except Sweden. In
   Scandinavia, there is no distinct regional pattern. Canada had a
   significantly higher Hg level in central than western regions in both
   tissues the opposite of that found for Cd and Pb.
   Cu and Zn showed significant variations from one location to another in
   liver and kidney in Canada and Norway, but only in kidney in samples
   from Sweden. Comparison between western and central Canada revealed a
   significant difference for Cu in liver, samples from central Canada
   having more, There are no significant differences from one country to
   another, but some localities in Canada seem to have higher Cu
   concentrations in kidney than are found in Scandinavia and Russia. (c)

Abstract = {Measuring activity levels in animals provides important information
   about their behavioral ecology and may be a relevant factor in
   management and conservation. We tested an individual-based method to
   discriminate active and passive behaviors on brown bears (Ursus arctos),
   using a dual-axis motion sensor mounted on Global Positioning
   System-Global System for Mobile Communications (GPS-GSM) collars. The
   method takes into account individual variation in activity levels and
   does not require further calibration. We validated the method through
   direct observations of captive bears and an extensive survey of wild
   bear signs in the boreal forest of central Sweden. We found good
   correspondence between sensor-measured and observed activity on captive
   bears. Analysis of wild bear signs at GPS locations and its comparison
   with the collar-based activity status confirmed the possibility of
   successfully applying the method to study brown bear activity patterns
   in the wild. The method provided 94.3\% correct activity classification
   on captive bears and about 78.2\% on wild bears. We tested the
   possibility of using this technique to measure increasing levels of
   activity by analyzing the correlation between the collar-derived numeric
   activity and the intensity of bear movement. At a broader scale (active
   vs. passive), the sensor-measured value provided information on the
   degree of activity, but no correlation was evident at a finer scale
   (specific behaviors). We suggest that using more sensors in different
   regions of a bear's body could overcome this difficulty and improve our
   knowledge of animal behavior in the wild, through remote monitoring of
   activity levels. We conclude that this method can be useful in the study
   of behavioral ecology of a wide range of animals, especially species
   that are difficult to observe or move great distances.},

Abstract = {The Norwegian-Russian border area is exposed to air pollution from
   Russian nickel-copper smelters at Kola Peninsula. An attempt was made to
   relate distribution and abundance of epiphytic lichens to concentrations

   Lichen cover showed significant correlation with Ni and Cu
   concentrations. However, since the deposition patterns of airborne heavy
   metals and sulphur dioxide (SO) around the smelters differ, some plots
   experience low lichen cover, despite low heavy metal concentrations.
   These plots are affected by relatively high SO, emissions. Climatic
   variability within the study area may also play a role in explaining
   variation in lichen cover. For areas with uniform climate and
   physiognomy nearer than ca. 20 km from the smelters, Ni concentrations
   in birch leaves may prove useful for estimating the likelihood for
   recolonization to take place. The area closest to the smelters presently
   is much too polluted for lichen recolonization to occur.},

Abstract = {Reproductive suppression through behavioral or physiological means is
   common in group-living and cooperative breeding mammals, but to our
   knowledge it has not been shown in wild large carnivores other than
   those with a clear form of social organization. Brown bear (Ursus
   arctos) females form matrilinear assemblages with related females using
   a common and largely exclusive area. Behavioral reproductive suppression
   might develop due to a hierarchical system among females within a
   matrilinear assemblage or due to inbreeding avoidance, because male
   brown bears can overlap with their daughters. We tested whether natal
   dispersal influenced the age of primiparity. We predicted that emigrant
   females, geographically removed from maternal or paternal influence,
   would reproduce earlier than philopatric females. The average age of
   primiparity was 4.3 years in females that dispersed outside their
   mother's home range (n=8) and 5.2 years in philopatric females (n=10).
   Only the overlap with the mother's home range, and not body size, body
   mass, growth, local population density, or overlap with the father's
   home range, had a significant influence on the age of primiparity. The
   ultimate role of reproductive suppression for brown bears is likely to
   avoid inbreeding or to minimize resource competition. Due to the low
   risk of inbreeding and frequent exposure of young females to unrelated
   males, we conclude that resource competition within female hierarchies
   causes reproductive suppression in young females.},

Abstract = {The migration of large aggregations of animals that sweep through the
   landscape is a phenomenon with large consequences in many ecosystems. It
   has been suggested that such migrations are mediated by resource
   depletion. Under this hypothesis it has been shown that simple foraging
   rules may generate density-dependent migratory waves ( DDMW) in which
   the speed and amplitude increase with animal abundance. We tested these
   predictions on a 32-year data set of the spatial distribution of the two
   youngest age groups of a small pelagic schooling fish, the capelin (
   Mallotus villosus), by the end of their annual feeding migration in the
   Barents Sea. Our data suggest that the two age groups divided the
   Barents Sea by forming migratory waves that moved in opposite
   directions. The aggregation and spatial displacement of these waves
   increased with increasing age-specific abundance. However, possibly
   through social interactions, migratory pattern was modified by the
   abundance of the other age group.},

Abstract = {Hypothesis: Salmonid fishes adapt to ice-cover conditions in their home
   river.
   Organism: Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) originating from six Norwegian
   populations along a climatic gradient (59-70 degrees N) ranging from
   insignificant natural ice cover (southern populations) to several months
   of extensive ice cover (northern populations).
   Site of experiments: NINA Research Station, Ims, south-western Norway
   (59 degrees N, 6 degrees E).
   Methods: Common environment experiments in tanks (manipulating light)
   comparing growth, food consumption, and growth efficiency under
   simulated ice cover (darkness) and no ice (6 h daylight), and comparison
   of energy-loss rates in semi-natural stream channels with or without
   simulated ice cover.
   Results: Mass standardized growth (Q) of the three southern populations
   from ice-free rivers was significantly higher in tanks with light (mean
   = 0.13) than in darkness (mean = -0.21), whereas the northern
   populations originating from rivers with ice cover showed smaller or
   insignificant differences in growth between light (mean = -0.01) and
   darkness (mean = 0.08). A similar pattern was found for food
   consumption. In stream channels, the differences in energy loss with and
   without simulated ice cover increased significantly with increasing
   latitude of population origin. Fish from the northern populations
   naturally experiencing extensive ice cover lost more energy without ice
   than fish from the southern populations, and are thus more susceptible
   to ice-cover removal.},

Abstract = {The small size of many African protected areas makes adjacent rangelands
   potentially important in the local survival of wild animals. In order to
   assess the importance of pastoral areas to wild ungulates, we studied
   density and habitat choice of wild ungulates and cattle in Lake Mburo
   National Park, Uganda, the adjacent exclusively pastoral Nshara Dairy
   Ranch and on private land consisting of a mixture of ranching and
   subsistence farms. Transects, in the three land-use zones, were walked
   during the wet season and the data were analysed by DISTANCE sampling
   technique. We found significantly higher total density of wild ungulates
   on the dairy ranch compared with the National Park and private land.
   There was no significant difference in total wild animal density between
   the National Park and private land. Impala (Aepyceros melampus), zebra
   (Equus quagga), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and waterbuck (Kobus
   ellipsiprymnus) had significantly higher densities on the dairy ranch
   compared to the National Park. Only eland (Taurotragus oryx) density was
   higher in the National Park compared to private land. Wild ungulates and
   cattle showed a high degree of habitat overlap, generally preferring
   open grassland. Our study shows that high densities of wild ungulates
   are not necessarily associated with protected areas. Pastoral areas may
   be important for populations of wild herbivores during the growing
   season despite a pronounced presence of livestock.},

Abstract = {A study of pelagic and littoral species richness among microcrustaceans
   in 2,466 Norwegian lakes recorded 120 crustacean species: 77
   cladocerans, 31 cyclopoids, and 12 calanoids, respectively. Very few
   species were strictly pelagic, and the pelagic crustacean zooplankton
   species were by far outnumbered by their littoral counterparts. More
   than two-thirds of the total crustacean species numbers in lakes were
   accounted for by species with a littoral preference. A considerable
   number of species occurred with low frequency, and the median total
   number of crustacean species in the lakes was only 14. A majority of
   littoral species also occurred commonly in pelagic samples, and vice
   versa. Some species are truly both littoral and pelagic, and nearly all
   species occurring in pelagic samples were also common in littoral
   samples. A high proportion of the common littoral species was only
   recorded occasionally in pelagic samples, and should thus be considered
   strictly littoral. There was no significant correlation between lake
   area and species richness for pelagic or littoral species. Our findings
   demonstrate the importance of including littoral species when assessing
   microcrustacean diversity in lakes, and we question the practice of
   considering species as either pelagic or littoral, because a majority of
   the recorded species was common in both habitats. It calls for a further
   discussion of the term ``planktonic{''}, since most of the species are
   at least partly ``semiplanktonic.{''}},

Abstract = {The extensive phenotypic polymorphism in the European whitefish has
   triggered evolutionary research in order to disentangle mechanisms
   underlying diversification. To illuminate the ecological distinctiveness
   in polymorphic whitefish, and evaluate taxonomic designations, we
   studied nine Norwegian lakes in three watercourses, which each harboured
   pairs of divergent whitefish morphs. We compared the morphology and life
   history of these morphs, documented the extent of genetic
   differentiation between them, and contrasted the niche use of sympatric
   morphs along both the habitat and resource axes. In all cases, sympatric
   morphs differed in the number of gill rakers, a highly heritable trait
   related to trophic utilization. Individual growth rate, age and size at
   maturity, diet and habitat use also differed between morphs within
   lakes, but were remarkably similar across lakes within the same morph.
   Microsatellite analyses confirmed for all but one pair that sympatric
   morphs were significantly genetically different, and that similar morphs
   from different lakes likely have a polyphyletic origin. These results
   are most compatible with the process of parallel evolution through
   recurrent postglacial divergence into pelagic and benthic niches in each
   of these lakes. We propose that sparsely and densely rakered whitefish
   sympatric pairs may be a likely case of ecological speciation, mediated
   in oligotrophic lakes with few trophic competitors.},

Abstract = {Six species of the lichen genus Usnea are reported from Norway north of
   the Arctic Circle (total study area of 97.000 km(2)). The distribution
   maps are based on herbarium records extensively supplemented by our own
   records. Usnea glabrescens and U. substerilis are reported for the first
   time from the study area, whereas U. lapponica is reported as new to
   Finnmark. The two former species and U. filipendula have their northern
   distribution limit in Tromso at 69 degrees 40'N. Usnea lapponica, U.
   hirta and U. subfloridana reach Finnmark, but none of them are common
   north or east of Tromso. Literature reports of U. barbata, U.
   chaetophora and U. florida from Nordland, and of U. filipendula from
   Finnmark are considered doubtful. Most site records of Usnea are from
   the middle boreal vegetation zone, and only 7\% of the site records are
   from the northern boreal zone. The northern boreal populations are
   considered as casual occurrences originating from long-distance
   dispersal, and not as locally established, self-propagating populations.
   The weakly oceanic vegetation section is the most preferred section
   along the coast-inland gradient with 70\% of all records. The abundance
   and population size of Usnea species vary considerably between sites.
   The density is generally below one thallus per 2500 m(2), but at some
   favourable sites we have counted up to 62 thalli per 2500 m(2). These
   sites are humid, relatively warm lowland areas close to sheltered sea
   surfaces.},

Abstract = {Intraspecific body mass in ungulates has often been shown to increase
   with latitude. The biological basis for such latitudinal gradients is,
   however, poorly known. Here we examined whether satellite-derived
   indices of environmental phenology, based on the normalised difference
   vegetation index (NDVI), as well as variables derived from
   meteorological stations, altitude, and population density, can explain
   latitudinal gradients and regional variation in body mass of Norwegian
   moose. The best model gave a considerably better fit than latitude
   alone, and included all explanatory environmental variables.
   Accordingly, heavy moose were found in areas with short and intense
   summers that were followed by long, cold winters, at low altitude
   relative to the tree-limit, and with low population density relative to
   the available plant biomass. This relationship was stronger for
   yearlings than for calves, except for the effect of population density.
   This indicates that differences in the characteristics of the vegetation
   quality and environmental phenology, as well as winter harshness and
   population density, are important factors that shape both the
   latitudinal and other geographical gradients in moose body mass.},

Title = {Costs of an immune challenge and terminal investment in a long-lived

Abstract = {An induced immune challenge can have two counteracting effects on an
   individual's reproductive investment. (1) The resource demand could
   increase to ``fuel{''} the immunologic reaction, which in turn can lead
   to an adaptive decrease in investment in resource-costly activities,
   such as reproduction. One the other hand, (2) the individual could
   assume that the immune activity it experiences is indicative of a
   serious infection. The latter can lead to an adaptive increase in
   reproductive investment in response to the reduced prospects of survival
   and future reproduction, so called ``terminal investment.{''} To measure
   such life-history-related consequences of increased immune activity, one
   group of incubating female Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) was
   injected with a nonpathogenic antigen (sheep red blood cells, SRBC)
   while controls were injected with sterile saline. The eider is a
   long-lived sea-duck. Females, who incubate the eggs and care for young
   without assistance from the male, engage in facultative anorexia during
   incubation leading to a large reduction in body mass. Eiders can abandon
   their young to other females at the cost of reduced young survival. The
   immune challenge resulted in a larger mass loss, a prolonged incubation
   period, and reduced return rate, demonstrating both short- and long-term
   costs of immune challenge. Additionally, in response to what might have
   been interpreted as reduced survival chances in immune-challenged
   females, these females more often tended their own brood after hatching,
   despite having suffered higher costs during incubation.},

Abstract = {Spawning migration timing of maiden Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and
   previous spawners was analysed in the catches in 1989-2004 in the large
   subarctic River Teno in the northernmost parts of Finland and Norway.
   The hypothesis was that the migration timing of previous spawners and
   their maiden counterparts is similar, with the migration timing similar
   between sexes. In most cases, however, previous spawners were observed
   to migrate into the River Teno and its tributaries earlier than their
   maiden counterparts. The difference in run timing was especially evident
   between maiden one-sea-winter (1SW) Atlantic salmon and the
   corresponding group of previous spawners {[}1S1, 1 year at sea (1)
   followed by first spawning (S) and reconditioning period of 1 year (1)
   at sea and second spawning run] for both sexes in the River Teno and in
   its two tributaries. The same was also evident between 2SW maiden and
   2S1 previous spawning female Atlantic salmon in the River Teno. Females
   showed earlier spawning migration than males both in previous spawners
   and maiden Atlantic salmon. Different maiden sea-age classes also showed
   differences in run timing as multi-sea-winter fish (2-4SW) ascended
   earlier than 1SW fish but the timing of 1S1 and 2S1 previous spawning
   females coincided. The results suggest that run timing of Atlantic
   salmon may not be strictly genetically fixed as previous spawners ascend
   earlier than they did on their first spawning migration as maiden fish,
   and indicated that the closeness of the reconditioning area of
   postspawners to the river of origin resulted in an early ascent. Run
   timing of different sea-age groups has major management implications if
   the populations are heavily exploited with numerous fishing methods in
   different periods of the fishing season, as in the River Teno system.

Volume = {87},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Most studies of animals' home-range sizes have focused on adults, and
   the home ranges of subadults are usually, at best, only mentioned
   anecdotally. In this paper we report home-range sizes of 56 philopatric
   sexually immature (1.5- and 2.5-year-old) brown bears (Ursus arctos) in
   2 Swedish study areas and how size is influenced by sex, age, body size,
   food availability, and population density. Home-range size was larger in
   males than in females, and home-range size increased with increasing
   body size, but was not related to individual age. Home-range size
   decreased with increasing population density, but less so in females
   than in males, a result consistent with the formation of matrilinear
   assemblages recently reported in brown bears. Although home ranges were
   larger in the less-productive northern study area than in the southern
   one, home-range size was not related to a general index of food
   availability.},

Abstract = {Accumulation of cadmium, mercury, lead, copper and zinc was studied in
   muscle, liver and kidney of 9 adult and 7 juvenile arctic hares (Lepus
   arcticus), collected in 2003 in the southwestern part of Nunavut,
   Canada. Our objective was to determine the level of heavy metal
   accumulation, and distribution among age groups and tissue.
   Concentrations of all metals varied among tissues, and concentrations of
   Cd, Hg and Zn were higher in adults compared to juveniles. We found
   correlations in metal content among tissues, and among metals in
   kidneys. We also found the hares to have low concentration of most heavy
   metals except cadmium. We suggest that the high cadmium levels might be
   caused by the local geology, and the hares being adapted to these
   levels. The low levels of the other metals are probably due to low input
   of atmospheric contaminants. Only one of the individuals had Cd content
   slightly above the maximum contaminant levels recommended for human
   consumption of meat. There were no levels in meat above the recommended
   maximum for the rest of the metals surveyed. However the Cd levels in
   liver and kidney are orders of magnitude higher than the recommended
   maximum, and consumption of these organs should be avoided. (c) 2006

Abstract = {In order to determine the effects of a megaherbivore, the African
   elephant (Loxodonta africana) on browse available for mesoherbivores, we
   assessed the vertical distribution of shoots (< 6 mm in diameter) on
   trees with different accumulated elephant impact. We also determined the
   foraging responses by a mixed feeder, impala (Aepyceros melampus) and a
   browser, greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) which are
   mesoherbivores. The foraging responses by impala and kudu were in terms
   of preferences of trees with different accumulated elephant impact
   levels and whether animals browsed in different height sections in
   proportion to availability of shoots. We counted shoots in each 20 cm
   height section up to 2.6 m on trees in 25 m by 25 m plots and on trees
   observed to be browsed by impala and kudu. In most tree species,
   individuals with high accumulated elephant impact were shorter and had
   more shoots at low levels than tree individuals with either low or no
   accumulated elephant impact. Impala and kudu preferred to browse tree
   individuals with accumulated elephant impact over those without such
   impact. Impala and kudu browsed more than expected at height sections
   with many shoots and less than expected at height sections with fewer
   shoots indicating a non-linear overmatching foraging response. We
   suggest that increased shoot abundance at low levels in the canopy might
   explain part of the observed preferences. Elephants, therefore, seem to
   facilitate browsing by mesoherbivores by generating `browsing lawns'.
   Such benefits need to be considered when making decisions on how to
   manage populations of megaherbivores like elephant. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {Recent changes in the status of Steller's Eider Polysticta stelleri
   wintering in Europe: a decline or redistribution?},

Abstract = {Steller's Eider Polysticta stelleri has a restricted arctic breeding
   range. The world population declined to c. 220,000 individuals in the
   late 1990s from an estimated 400,000-500,000 in the 1960s. The species
   has a limited global wintering distribution, occurring in marine
   habitats in north-east Europe, islands close to Kamchatka in Russia, and
   the eastern Aleutian Islands and south-west Alaska. European wintering
   numbers were estimated at 30,000-50,000 in the early 1990s, when the
   population was considered of favourable conservation status. Recent
   census data from the most important European wintering sites show annual
   declines of 8\% in Norway since 1984, 9\% in Estonia since 1994 and 22\%
   in Lithuania since 1995, suggesting an overall 65\% reduction in Europe.
   Counts in 1994 suggested that 30-50\% of the European population
   wintered in Russia at that time. Current census data from Russia show
   similar declines along monitored sections of the Kola Peninsula
   wintering grounds since 1994. Accounting for trends in Russia, the
   current European wintering population could possibly stand at
   10,000-15,000 individuals (a more than a 50\% decline in 10 years),
   qualifying this population as Endangered under IUCN criteria. The
   changes in Baltic/Norwegian wintering numbers did not correlate with
   changes in the extent of ice-free marine waters in the Kola
   Peninsula/White Sea areas, but changes in annual numbers in Norway were
   correlated with winter North Atlantic Oscillation indices. Variation in
   annual numbers in the Baltic Sea correlated with projected number of
   juveniles among wintering birds. However, none of the possible causes
   discussed in this paper could fully explain the decline in Steller's
   Eider, confirming the need for comprehensive monitoring of the
   population throughout its winter range and for cohesive demographic
   monitoring to target effective conservation action.},

Abstract = {Stomach samples from 1384 Atlantic salmon, collected from 1991 to 2003
   in the Northeast Atlantic, were analysed to fill the gap between studies
   on post-smolt diet in fjords and coastal areas of the Northeast Atlantic
   and studies on the diet of pre-adults and adults in the Norwegian Sea.
   The post-smolts fed largely on 0-group fish. Blue whiting was an
   important prey only in the slope current transporting the larvae from
   the spawning areas west of the United Kingdom into the North and
   Norwegian Seas. Sandeel and herring were important or present in the
   stomachs throughout most of the area studied. Unusually large quantities
   of 0-group herring in the Norwegian Sea in summer 2002 coincided with a
   high condition factor of post-smolts that year. The forage ratio of the
   post-smolts was positively related to the proportion of herring in the
   stomachs and the abundance of herring recruits. Despite these findings,
   the most productive period for Atlantic salmon on record, the 1970s,
   coincided with the collapse of the Norwegian spring-spawning herring,
   which raises the question as to whether herring is more important as a
   competitor than as a food source. Hyperiid amphipods were more important
   prey than krill, in contrast to the situation for other pelagic fish
   species. (c) 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Title = {Population characteristics predict responses in moose body mass to

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {75},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1110-1118},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. A general problem in population ecology is to predict under which
   conditions stochastic variation in the environment has the stronger
   effect on ecological processes. By analysing temporal variation in a
   fitness-related trait, body mass, in 21 Norwegian moose Alces alces (L.)
   populations, we examined whether the influence of temporal variation in
   different environmental variables were related to different parameters
   that were assumed to reflect important characteristics of the
   fundamental niche space of the moose.
   2. Body mass during autumn was positively related to early access to
   fresh vegetation in spring, and to variables reflecting slow
   phenological development (low June temperature, a long spring with a
   slow plant progression during spring). In contrast, variables related to
   food quantity and winter conditions had only a minor influence on
   temporal variation in body mass.
   3. The magnitude of the effects of environmental variation on body mass
   was larger in populations with small mean body mass or living at higher
   densities than in populations with large-sized individuals or living at
   lower densities.
   4. These results indicate that the strongest influence of environmental
   stochasticity on moose body mass occurs towards the borders of the
   fundamental niche space, and suggests that populations living under good
   environmental conditions are partly buffered against fluctuations in
   environmental conditions.},

Pages = {860-869},

Abstract = {Mean size of sexually mature anadromous brown trout (sea trout) Salmo
   trutta in south-east Norway increased significantly with migratory
   distance (D) between the feeding area at sea and the spawning area in
   fresh water, from 32 cm for those spawning close to the river mouth to
   43 cm at the spawning grounds 40 km inland. This was largely due to an
   increased size of the smallest anadromous spawners with increasing D.
   The raised mean size of the long-distance migrants is paralleled by an
   increased age at sexual maturity. Body mass at the same length of sea
   trout decreased with D in fresh water, meaning that the fish moving far
   inland was slimmer than those spawning near the coast. Gonadal mass of
   first-time spawning anadromous males declined significantly with D, and
   the fecundity and the ratio of fecundity over mean mass of the
   individual eggs adjusted for variation in fish mass, increased with D.
   There was no clear relationship between the ratio of anadromous to
   resident fish and D, probably because more variables than D, influence
   this relationship in the study streams. (c) 2006 The Authors Journal

Abstract = {This study aimed to test how the sex and reproductive status of Eurasian
   lynx influenced their use of `attractive sinks' - habitats with high

   Lynx lynx were obtained by radio-telemetry in a mixed forest and
   agricultural habitat in south-eastern Norway. Roe deer, the major food
   source of lynx in the study area, occurred at higher densities closer to
   areas of human activity and infrastructure. Proximity of lynx locations
   to human activity and infrastructure was used as a risk index because
   the most common causes of death among Scandinavian lynx were of
   anthropogenic origin. This study shows that distances from lynx
   locations to human activity were significantly greater for females with
   newborn kittens than for males, but this decreased with kitten age. The
   data suggest that this response to human activity is influenced by the
   reproductive strategies of males and females, and might explain
   male-biased human-induced mortality in this study and in carnivores more

Title = {Population structure in a critically endangered arctic fox population:

Volume = {15},
Number = {10},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) in Scandinavia is classified as
   critically endangered after having gone through a severe decline in
   population size in the beginning of the 20th century, from which it has
   failed to recover despite more than 65 years of protection. Arctic foxes
   have a high dispersal rate and often disperse over long distances,
   suggesting that there was probably little population differentiation
   within Scandinavia prior to the bottleneck. It is, however, possible
   that the recent decline in population size has led to a decrease in
   dispersal and an increase in population fragmentation. To examine this,
   we used 10 microsatellite loci to analyse genetic variation in 150
   arctic foxes from Scandinavia and Russia. The results showed that the
   arctic fox in Scandinavia presently is subdivided into four populations,
   and that the Kola Peninsula and northwest Russia together form a large
   fifth population. Current dispersal between the populations seemed to be
   very low, but genetic variation within them was relatively high. This
   and the relative F-ST values among the populations are consistent with a
   model of recent fragmentation within Scandinavia. Since the amount of
   genetic variation is high within the populations, but the populations
   are small and isolated, demographic stochasticity seems to pose a higher
   threat to the populations' persistence than inbreeding depression and
   low genetic variation.},

Abstract = {In hierarchical patch systems, small-scale patches of high density are
   nested within large-scale patches of low density. The organization of
   multiple-scale hierarchical systems makes non-random strategies for
   dispersal and movement particularly important. Here, we apply a new
   method based on first-passage time on the pathway of a foraging seabird,
   the Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), to quantify its foraging
   pattern and the spatial dynamics of its foraging areas. Our results
   suggest that Antarctic petrels used a nested search strategy to track a
   highly dynamic hierarchical patch system where small-scale patches were
   congregated within patches at larger scales. The birds searched for
   large-scale patches by traveling fast and over long distances. Once
   within a large-scale patch, the birds concentrated their search to find
   smaller scale patches. By comparing the pathway of different birds we
   were able to quantify the spatial scale and turnover of their foraging
   areas. On the largest scale we found foraging areas with a
   characteristic scale of about 400 km. Nested within these areas we found
   foraging areas with a characteristic scale of about 100 km. The
   large-scale areas disappeared or moved within a time frame of weeks
   while the nested small-scale areas disappeared or moved within days.
   Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the dominant food item of
   Antarctic petrels and we suggest that our findings reflect the spatial
   dynamics of krill in the area.},

   are thought to be the most sensitive species with regard to habitat
   changes and human disturbance. Nowadays wolverines in Scandinavia are
   found in remote high alpine areas, and we investigated whether human
   development through presence of infrastructure has relegated them to
   these areas. We analysed wolverine habitat selection and the impact of
   infrastructure in two study areas in Norway using compositional
   analysis. We found that alpine tundra with low human development was
   important for wolverines to locate their home ranges. Human development
   formed a more important factor for home range location than did habitat,
   because habitat selectivity was much higher in undeveloped habitats than
   in developed habitats. Within their home ranges, wolverines used alpine
   shrubland and forest, irrespective of human development. The sympatric
   distribution of wolverines with wild and semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer
   tarandus indicates that wolverines are vulnerable to indirect loss of
   habitat. However, we hypothesise that wolverine distribution may be
   partly influenced by direct disturbance or higher risk of human-caused
   mortality associated with infrastructure. Increased human development
   and activity in once remote areas may thus cause reduced ability of
   wolverines to perform their daily activities unimpeded, making the
   habitat less optimal or causing wolverines to avoid the disturbed area.
   Our results suggest that the potential exists for further wolverine
   recovery in forest ecosystems with low levels of infrastructural
   development.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the role of cold condensation and
   fractionation on the occurrence of organochlorine contaminants (OCs) in
   avian marine top predators along a latitudinal gradient. We measured 24
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and six pesticide OCs in blood
   of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) from the Norwegian Coast (58
   degrees N-70 degrees N) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) from
   Bjornoya in the Norwegian Arctic (74 degrees N). Glaucous gulls had up
   to 3 times higher Sigma OC concentrations compared to the great
   black-backed gulls, and a OC pattern dominated largely by persistent and
   low volatile compounds such as highly chlorinated PCBs and metabolites
   such as oxychlordane. This was not consistent with cold condensation and
   fractionation theory, but probably related to diet and elevated
   biomagnification. Among great black-backed gulls, however, there were
   indications of both cold condensation and fractionation. Higher and
   lower chlorinated PCBs had highest absolute concentrations in the south
   and in the north, respectively, except for one location at an
   intermediate latitude, where concentrations of most OCs exceeded all
   other locations. In terms of proportional contribution to Sigma OC
   (pattern), relatively volatile OCs such as HCB, oxychlordane and tri- to
   penta- PCB congeners were more important at northern latitudes, while
   hexa- to nona-PCBs made up a larger proportion of Sigma OC in the south.
   The results thus showed that differences in global distribution of
   compounds with different physicochemical properties could be detected in
   avian top predators such as large gulls, even if biomagnification and
   biotransformation influence both the absolute concentrations and the
   patterns of OCs.},

Title = {Patterns of hunting mortality in Norwegian moose (Alces alces)
   populations},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {153-163},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We used a simple life table approach to examine the age-specific
   patterns of harvest mortality in eight Norwegian moose populations
   during the last 15 years and tried to determine if the observed patterns
   were caused by hunter selectivity. The general opinion among local
   managers is that hunters prefer to shoot female moose not in company
   with calves to keep a high number of reproductive females in the
   population (and because of the emotional stress involved in leaving the
   calf/calves without a mother), and relatively large males because of the
   higher return with respect to meat and trophy. In support of the former
   view, we found the harvest mortality of adult females to be higher among
   pre-prime (1-3 years old) than prime-aged age classes (4-7 years old).
   This is probably because prime-aged females are more fecund and,
   therefore, more likely to be in company with one or two calves during
   the hunting season. As the season progressed, however, the selection
   pressure on barren females decreased, probably due to more productive
   females becoming `legal' prey as their calf/calves were harvested. In
   males, we did not find any evidence of strong age-specific hunter
   selectivity, despite strong age-dependent variation in body mass and
   antler size. We suggest that this was due to the current strongly
   female-biased sex ratio in most Norwegian moose populations, which
   leaves the hunters with few opportunities to be selective within a
   relatively short and intensive hunting season. The management
   implications of these findings and to what extent the results are likely
   to affect the future evolution of life histories in Norwegian moose
   populations are discussed.},

Abstract = {When cultured Atlantic salmon are released into nature, they compete
   with wild fish for food, space, and breeding partners. As a result of
   morphological, physiological, ecological, and behavioural changes that
   occur in hatcheries, their comp etitive ability often differs from that
   of wild fish. These changes are partly phenotypic and partly genetic.
   Cultured juveniles' faster growth rate influences age and size at
   smelting and maturity, reproductive output, and longevity. Fast-growing
   parr tend to smolt younger, produce more but smaller eggs, attain
   maturity earlier, and die younger. Juvenile learning influences a number
   of behavioural traits, and differences in early experience appear to
   affect feeding and spawning success, migratory behaviour, and homing
   ability. Genetic change in hatcheries is chiefly the result of natural
   selection, with differential mortality among genotypes and broodstock
   selection based on production traits such as high adult body mass and
   fast growth rate. Experimental evidence has revealed that cultured
   parr's greater aggression often allows them to dominate wild part,
   although smaller cultured part can be subordinated if they co-occur in
   fast-flowing water and if wild smolts have established prior residence.
   During spawning, the fitness of wild salmon is superior to that of
   cultured conspecifics. Cultured males are inferior to wild males in
   intra-sexual competition, courting, and spawning; cultured females have
   greater egg retention, construct fewer nests, and are less efficient at
   covering their eggs in the substratum than their wild counterparts. In
   rivers, the early survival of cultured offspring is lower than that of
   their wild counterparts. The lifetime reproductive success of farmed
   fish has been estimated at 17\% that of similar-sized wild salmon. As a
   result of ecological interaction and through density-dependent
   mechanisms, cultured fish may displace wild conspecifics to some extent,
   increase their mortality, and decrease their growth rate, adult size,
   reproductive output, biomass, and production. (c) 2006 International

Abstract = {In Norway, there have been restrictions on salmon farming in several
   fjords to reduce the potential negative impact on important stocks of
   wild Atlantic salmon. Little is known about the incidence of escaped

   fish fanning in nearby areas. In this study, we analysed data on the
   incidence of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon in angling catches and
   broodstock fisheries in rivers for a 16-year period (1989-2004). These
   data were weighted using official catch statistics and combined at the
   county level, and the incidence of escapees was correlated with both the
   stock of farmed salmon in net pens and the reported number of escapees
   in different Norwegian counties. Our results indicate a significant
   positive correlation between the incidence of escaped farmed salmon in
   the rivers at the county level and the intensity of salmon fanning,
   measured as the number of fanned salmon in net pens, suggesting that
   protection areas may reduce the impact of escapees in salmon populations

Abstract = {Many salmon escape from fish farms during autumn and winter, making the
   migratory pattern and survival to sexual maturity of these fish an
   interesting topic of study. This study aimed to assess the migration and
   survival of large fanned salmon released from fish farms at different
   times during autumn and winter. Fanned salmon were individually tagged
   with external tags and released from two fish farms, one in southern
   Norway and the other in northern Norway. Salmon released in autumn one
   year before attaining sexual maturity appeared to survive poorly to
   sexual maturation, whereas salmon escaping later in winter showed
   greater survival. The released salmon appeared to move with the current
   and appeared to have a very weak homing instinct, if any. Based on the
   results of the tagging experiments, the direction and speed of ocean
   currents, and information about the abundance of fish farm escapees in
   salmon fisheries and stocks in several countries in the Northeast
   Atlantic, two hypotheses are advanced: first, salmon that escape during
   early autumn the year before they become sexually mature are transported
   with the currents to Arctic areas and subsequently do not survive the
   winter; second, large salmon escaping from fish farms in Ireland,
   Scotland, the Faroe Islands, and Norway during winter and spring move
   with the current and, during the following summer or autumn, may enter
   homewater fisheries and spawning populations far away from the site of
   escape, when they become sexually mature. (c) 2006 International Council

Abstract = {Cultured salmonids are released or escape into the wild in large numbers
   and may make up significant proportions of wild salmonid populations in
   fresh- and saltwater, causing considerable concern for the fitness and
   productivity of these populations. This paper focuses on the effects of
   escaped fanned Atlantic salmon (Sahno sular) on wild salmon. Farmed
   salmon have been under artificial selection for growth and other
   economically important traits for 30 years and are genetically different
   in their origin at the molecular and quantitative genetic levels.
   Escaped farmed salmon spawn in the wild with limited success. Their
   offspring outgrow those of wild origin but suffer higher mortality.
   Whole-river experiments in Ireland and Norway have shown that the
   lifetime success of farmed salmon is reduced relative to wild salmon.
   Based on data from these experiments, we model the future of wild salmon
   populations experiencing invasions of escaped fanned salmon. Simulations
   with a fixed intrusion rate of 20\% escaped farmed salmon at spawning
   suggest that substantial changes take place in wild salmon populations
   within ten salmon generations (similar to 40 years). Low-invasion
   scenarios suggest that farmed offspring are unlikely to become
   established in the population, whereas high-invasion scenarios suggest
   that populations are eventually mixtures of hybrid and farmed
   descendants. Recovery of the wild population is not likely under all
   circumstances, even after many decades without further intrusion.
   Managers of wild salmon will have difficulty in obtaining broodstock of
   the original wild population after a few generations of high intrusion.
   We conclude that further measures to reduce escapes of fanned salmon and
   their spawning in wild populations are urgently needed. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Several studies have documented the genetic effects of intraspecific
   hybridization of cultured and wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).
   However, the effect of salmon aquaculture on wild congeners is not so
   well understood. Diseases, introduced or increased in incidence by
   salmon aquaculture activities, may have an impact on co-occurring wild
   sea trout (Salmo trutta L.), as implied by the steep decline in sea
   trout numbers in many Irish, Scottish, and Norwegian rivers since the
   late 1980s, which may be linked to sea lice infestations associated with
   marine salmonid farming. Our data suggest that salmon farming and ocean
   ranching can indirectly affect, most likely mediated by disease, the
   genetics of cohabiting sea trout by reducing variability at major
   histocompatibility class I genes. We studied samples of DNA extracted
   from scales of sea trout in the Burrishoole River, in the west of
   Ireland, before and at intervals during aquaculture activities. In these
   samples, allelic variation at a microsatellite marker, tightly linked to
   a locus critical to immune response (Satr-UBA), was compared with
   variation at six neutral microsatellite loci. A significant decline in
   allefic richness and gene diversity at the Satr-UBA marker locus,
   observed since aquaculture started and which may indicate a selective
   response, was not reflected by similar reductions at neutral loci.
   Subsequent recovery of variability at the Satr-UBA marker, seen among
   later samples, may reflect an increased contribution by resident brown
   trout to the remaining sea trout stock. (c) 2006 International Council

Abstract = {The relationship between home range size and body mass is a frequently
   studied allometric relationship. However, the results of various studies
   differ greatly, leading to much debate about the nature of the
   relationship. We argue that this confusion is not surprising, due to
   intra-specific variation in home range size caused by ecological
   variability rather than by body mass. By random resampling of different
   studies from within 16 Carnivora species, we show that the scaling
   exponent ranged from 0.30-1.54 depending on the particular studies
   included for each species. Of these exponents, 10\% did not contain 0.75
   within their confidence limits, and 5.5\% did not contain 1.00.
   Furthermore, by randomly sub-sampling 16 species from a total sample of
   58 species, we found that the scaling exponent varied between 0.18 and
   2.76. Of these exponents, 42.2\% did not contain 0.75 within their
   confidence limits, whereas 16.8\% did not contain 1.00. Therefore, we
   strongly recommend that greater consideration be paid to intra-specific
   ecological variability and taxa selection when dealing with both
   allometry and cross-species life history studies.},

Title = {Survival rates and causes of mortality in Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in

Abstract = {Causes of mortality were described for 245 radio-marked Eurasian lynx
   (Lynx lynx) in five different Scandinavian study areas. Further-more,
   the survival rates and the population growth rates were estimated for
   three of the study areas where 202 lynx were followed for a total of 314
   radio-years. The main causes of mortality in adult Eurasian lynx in all
   our study areas were overwhelmingly anthropogenic, with starvation,
   vehicle collisions, intra- and interspecific killing and disease only
   having a minor role. The mean mortality rates for adults increased from
   2\% to 17\% when hunting and poaching were included, i.e., an increase
   by a factor of eight. This in turn had a large impact on population
   growth rates, which changed from more than a 20\% annual increase to
   only a 2-4\% when hunting and poaching were included. Poaching accounted
   for 46\% of the mortality in adult lynx. Poaching and legal harvest
   appear to be primarily motivated by conflicts; lynx depredation on
   semi-domestic reindeer in northern Scandinavia, competition with hunters
   for roe deer in southern Scandinavia, and depredation on free-ranging
   domestic sheep in all Norway. The lowest poaching rate was found in the
   Hedmark study area in Norway, which also had a high legal harvest. The
   poaching rate was higher in one of the Swedish study areas (Sarek) where
   legal hunting was lower than in other areas. on the other hand, both the
   poaching rate and the legal harvest were high in the Akershus/Ostfold
   study area in Norway. Thus, there does not seem to be a simple
   relationship between an increased legal harvest and decreased poaching
   as is commonly expected. The most important conservation actions are to
   combat poaching through both law enforcement and measures designed to
   increase tolerance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing environmental vulnerability in EIA - The content and context
   of the vulnerability concept in an alternative approach to standard EIA
   procedure},

Abstract = {In the traditional EIA procedure environmental vulnerability is only
   considered to a minor extent in the early stages when project
   alternatives are worked out. In Norway, an alternative approach to EIA,
   an integrated vulnerability model (IVM), emphasising environmental
   vulnerability and alternatives development in the early stages of EIA,
   has been tried out in a few pilot cases. This paper examines the content
   and use of the vulnerability concept in the IVM approach, and discusses
   the concept in an EIA context.
   The vulnerability concept is best suited to overview analyses and large
   scale spatial considerations. The concept is particularly useful in the
   early stages of EIA when alternatives are designed and screened. By
   introducing analyses of environmental vulnerability at the start of the
   EIA process, the environment can be a more decisive issue for the
   creation of project alternatives as well as improving the basis for
   scoping.
   Vulnerability and value aspects should be considered as separate
   dimensions. There is a need to operate with a specification between
   general and specific vulnerability. The concept of environmental
   vulnerability has proven useful in a wide range of disciplines.
   Different disciplines have different lengths of experience regarding
   vulnerability. In disciplines such as landscape planning and
   hydrogeology we find elements suitable as cornerstones in the further
   development of an interdisciplinary methodology. Further development of
   vulnerability criteria in different disciplines and increased public
   involvement in the early stages of EIA are recommended. (c) 2006

Abstract = {We compared seasonal composition, abundance, and biomass of seabirds
   between the Northeast (ICES region) and Northwest (NAFO region) Atlantic
   fisheries regions to identify differences in community assemblage and
   prey consumption. Seabirds were more abundant in the Northwest Atlantic,
   but biomass was greater in the Northeast. This disparity resulted from
   enormous numbers of little auks Alle alle breeding in West Greenland and
   of Leach's storm-petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa breeding in Newfoundland,
   plus large numbers of non-breeding shearwaters Puffinus spp. entering
   southern NAFO areas in summer. The Northeast Atlantic communities were
   dominated numerically by northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis, large auks
   Uria spp., and the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica. Seabirds
   occupying the North Atlantic consume approximately 11 X 10(6) t of food
   annually. Overall consumption rates peak during summer as a result of
   increased breeding activity and seasonal movements of birds into the
   North Atlantic. Because of the greater biomass of birds in the
   northeast, consumption (mainly by piscivores) in ICES areas was
   approximately 20\% higher than that in NAFO areas, where planktivores
   dominate. NAFO areas had, however, a much greater consumption rate per
   unit area than ICES areas. Comparative studies such as these could prove
   informative in assessing large predator responses to the influence of
   fishing and ocean-scale climate change. (c) 2006 International Council

Abstract = {Gene transfer may occur following hybridization between closely related
   species if hybrids are viable and able to breed with individuals of one
   or both of the parental species. House (Passer domesticus) and tree
   sparrows (P. montanus) occasionally hybridize and produce viable
   offspring. Previously, we concluded that male tree x house sparrow
   hybrids are most probably fertile based on the observation of a male F1
   hybrid feeding the nestlings with a female house sparrow in two
   consecutive clutches. However, recent DNA analyses based on blood
   samples revealed that all nestlings (4) in the first clutch were sired
   by a neighbouring house sparrow male, whereas nestlings in the second
   clutch (2) were not blood sampled and most probably died before
   fledging. This indicates that extensive extra-pair fertilization
   confounded our previous conclusion, and indicates that social
   partnership and attending behaviour can be imprecise measures of
   paternity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},

Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Body size and mass have a strong effect on an individual's fitness, and
   conditions experienced early in life may affect survival to adulthood,
   age and size at maturation, and reproductive success. For this reason,
   body size and mass of 226 yearling brown bears Ursus arctos were
   analysed in relation to maternal size, litter size, sex, multilocus
   heterozygosity, population density and cohort in two study areas in
   Sweden. Body mass of yearlings varied from 8 to 48 kg (X=24.5 +/-
   0.5(SE)). Yearling body size and mass were positively related to
   maternal size and negatively related to litter size. Males were on
   average 2.6\% larger and 7.8\% heavier than females. Population density
   negatively affected both size and mass of yearlings. Yearling body size
   and mass varied among cohorts, but data on food availability were not
   available to evaluate the relationship between food availability and
   size and mass of yearlings. Maternal age and multilocus heterozygosity
   did not seem to influence yearling body size or mass. Body mass of
   yearlings varied within litters, especially in litters with three
   offspring, where the heaviest yearling was on average 29.5 +/- 2.8\%
   ((SE)) heavier than the lightest one. This suggests that competition
   among offspring increases with litter size, thereby having a pronounced
   negative effect on the smallest offspring. Survival of subadult brown
   bears from ages 1 to 3 increased with increasing yearling body size.},

Abstract = {Most of the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) populations in
   Europe experienced dramatic declines during the twentieth century.
   However, owing to intense conservation actions and the ban of DDT and
   other persistent pollutants, populations are currently recovering. We
   show that despite passing through demographic bottlenecks, white-tailed
   eagle populations have retained significant levels of genetic diversity.
   Both genetic and ringing data indicate that migration between
   populations has not been a major factor for the maintenance of genetic
   variability. We argue that the long generation time of eagles has acted
   as an intrinsic buffer against loss of genetic diversity, leading to a
   shorter effective time of the experienced bottleneck. Notably,
   conservation actions taken in several small sub-populations have ensured
   the preservation of a larger proportion of the total genetic diversity
   than if conservation had focused on the population stronghold in Norway.
   For conservation programmes targeting other endangered, long-lived
   species, our results highlight the possibility for local retention of
   high genetic diversity in isolated remnant populations.},

Abstract = {We studied the role of red deer Cervus elaphus L. as ecosystem modi. er
   in boreal forest (Tingvoll municipality, 62 degrees 52' N, 8 degrees
   20'E, Norway), during early summer of 2001. The effect of grazing by red
   deer on ground beetles (Carabidae) abundance and diversity was
   investigated across a gradient of grazing pressures. We trapped ground
   beetles by pit-fall traps from three homogeneous winter grazing areas
   (ungrazed, medium grazed, heavily grazed). Bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus
   (the main winter food for red deer) was sampled and its dry weight was
   measured for the three locations. Gradient analyses showed that grazing
   by red deer affects carabid species composition. Grazing significantly
   affected the amount of bilberry, which correlated with species
   variation. According to our predictions, we found a higher abundance of
   carabids in the heavily grazed location, but the species richness and
   the diversity indices were similar for the three areas. This study shows
   that overall species composition is altered along a gradient as
   consequence of red deer winter grazing and that red deer act as
   ecosystem engineer, by reducing the bilberry heather which dominates the
   field layer in early summer.},

   years. Four factors were considered in our analysis of the determinants
   of adult female size: annual food conditions, population density,
   multilocus heterozygosity, and yearling body size. Our results suggest
   that individual body size variation of female brown bears is negatively
   related to density-dependent factors and positively correlated to
   density-independent fluctuations in the environment. Density-dependent
   factors may operate by increasing competition for food, resulting in a
   decrease in body size. Food resources for brown bears in Sweden
   fluctuate annually in the boreal forest and influence individual body
   size. Multilocus heterozygosity and yearling body size were not
   important in explaining adult size, because initially smaller
   individuals show compensatory growth when experiencing good food
   conditions.},

Title = {The partitioning of density-dependent dispersal, growth and survival
   throughout ontogeny in a highly fecund organism},

Abstract = {The way in which density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst
   survival, growth and dispersal are key in determining the temporal and
   spatial dynamics of populations. Here we propose a mechanistic approach
   to understanding how the relative importance of these sources of density
   dependence can change over ontogeny through changes in dispersal
   abilities, energy stores and mortality risks. Whereas the potential for
   active dispersal typically increases over ontogeny as a function of body
   size, susceptibility to starvation and predation decreases. The joint
   effect of these mechanisms suggests a general model for the ontogenetic
   sequence of how density dependence is manifested, with density
   dependence early in ontogeny being primarily expressed as mortality on
   local spatial scales, whereas later stages respond to local density in
   terms of dispersal and potentially growth. Here we test this model by
   manipulating the densities of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.)
   at two life-history stages in the wild. Density-dependent mortality
   during the early juvenile stage (i.e. fry at onset of exogenous feeding)
   was accompanied by no effects on body size and weak effects on
   dispersal. In contrast, dispersal of older juveniles (i.e. parr 2-3
   months after onset of feeding) was strongly density-dependent, with more
   individuals emigrating from high-density release sites, and with no
   effect of initial density on mortality. This dispersal, however,
   appeared insufficient to produce an ideal free distribution within the
   study stream, as indicated by the effect of spatial variation in density
   on body size by the end of the first growth season. These results
   demonstrate that the way density-dependent effects are partitioned
   amongst survival, growth and dispersal changes throughout ontogeny.
   Furthermore, these changes occur in correlation with changes in
   individual mortality risks and dispersal abilities, and suggest a
   general paradigm for the way in which juvenile density-dependence is
   manifest in spatially structured populations of highly fecund organisms.},

Title = {Variation in stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in Hokkaido
   sika deer Cervus nippon during 1990-2000: possible causes and
   implications for management},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sika deer Cervus nippon populations in eastern Hokkaido, Japan,
   increased rapidly during 1990-1998. This increase appeared to have
   halted in 1999-2000, probably due to increased hunting and nuisance
   control. The period of rapid increase was associated with a
   disproportionately rapid increase in compensation paid for deer damage
   to crops. We studied changes in diet during 19902000, as reflected by
   stable isotope ratios of C and N in tooth collagen. We hypothesised that
   isotope ratios would demonstrate dietary shifts related to population
   levels and/or time, and that shifts in isotope ratios would be
   consistent with increasing individual consumption of pasture grasses at
   higher population levels. delta C-13 isotope ratios of tooth collagen in
   3-year-old sika indicated a diet dominated by C3 plants throughout the
   period, and that forage species other than pasture grasses and dwarf
   bamboo Sasa nipponica (the main crop and woodland understory plants,
   respectively) were important elements. There was a significant decline
   in the delta C-13 isotope ratio during 1990-2000 in both males and
   females. delta N-15 values showed no trend with time for males, but
   increased over time in females. Indices of population (Sightings per
   Unit Effort, SPUE) were negatively correlated with female delta C-13,
   and positively correlated with female delta N-15, values, indicating a
   shift in diet over the period, especially among females. This shift may
   be related to population and/or offtake levels, in particular the rapid
   increase in female offtake for nuisance control and hunting during the
   period. The data are consistent with a relative increase in pasture
   grass consumption per individual at higher population levels; however,
   other explanations of the data are equally plausible. Possible dietary
   changes, and other factors, influencing the observed shift in isotope
   ratios are discussed. Although statistically significant, the magnitude
   of dietary shifts nevertheless appeared small, and did not provide
   evidence which would justify modifying the current policy, of limiting
   crop damage through managed population reduction to about 25\% of peak
   levels.},

Title = {The plant vigour hypothesis revisited - how is browsing by ungulates and

Volume = {184},

Abstract = {The way herbivores select what to eat is of considerable practical and
   theoretical interest, and has given rise to different theories and
   hypotheses. The plant vigour hypothesis predicts that herbivores feed
   preferentially on vigorous, i.e., large and/or fast-growing plants or
   plant parts. These predictions have previously primarily been tested on
   variation within plant species. Here we test whether differences in
   vigour among plant species in the same environment can explain
   differences in herbivore attack. We studied variation in browsing
   pressure by a guild of large herbivores on different woody species in an
   African savanna ecosystem. Shoot growth rate, annual shoot length, basal
   shoot diameter and annual shoot volume of 14 woody plant species were
   measured in the field. Plant species' shoot vigour represented by the
   first PCA axis scores generated from the four shoot variables were then
   related to browsing pressure (\% utilisation) on each of the species by
   native ungulates and elephant. Nutrient and fibre concentrations and
   tannin activity were also determined for the 14 woody plant species. We
   found ungulate browsing pressure to show a unimodal relationship with
   plant species' shoot vigour. The heaviest browsing pressure was on plant
   species with shoots of intermediate vigour. We suggest that species with
   less vigorous shoots had low nutrient and high fibre concentrations and
   offered small bite sizes, whereas species with vigorous shoots had high
   nutrient concentrations but larger shoot diameters than the bite
   diameters of browsing ungulates. Elephant browsing pressure was not
   related to plant species' shoot vigour.},

Abstract = {Different organochlorine compounds (M) were measured in the blood of
   breeding south polar skuas (Catharacta maccormicki) at Svarthamaren,
   Dronning Maud Land (Antarctica) and compared to those in two species of
   northern hemisphere gulls: the Arctic glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus)
   and the subarctic great black-backed gull (Larus marinus). The skuas had
   8\% and 29\% of the Sigma OC levels (45 ng/g, wet weight) of glaucous
   gulls (591 ng/g) and great black-backed gulls (158 ng/g), respectively.
   Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were very low in skuas
   compared to northern gulls, but the mean hexachlorobenzene (HCB) level
   was 1.7 times higher than in great black-backed gulls and one-third of
   the glaucous gull level. Mirex levels in skuas were among the highest
   reported in birds, the mean level being 3 and 26 times higher than those
   in glaucous gull and great black-backed gulls, respectively. In skuas,
   the mean levels of HCB, oxychlordane, p,p'-DDE, and PCBs increased by
   about 30\% during a 2-week period, and mirex increased by nearly 60\%.
   In glacuous gulls, HCB, p,p'-DDE, and PCBs increased by 10-20\%. For
   HCB, mirex, and oxychlordane, only a relatively small proportion of the
   increase in skuas could be explained by changes in lipid pools and the
   levels at first sampling, compared to glaucous gulls. Thus, skuas were
   probably accumulating these compounds when present in Antarctica.
   p,p'-DDE and PCB levels, in contrast, seemed much more stable in the
   skuas. Relatively high levels of mirex and HCB in south polar skuas are
   concerning with regard to potential adverse effects.},

Journal = {AFRICAN ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ungulates can reduce the quantity of food available for other herbivores
   in general or reduce the available cover for small mammals in
   particular. On the other hand, browsing and grazing may facilitate
   foraging by other mammals if the quality and palatability of young
   re-sprouting tissue is high. An exclosure experiment was set up in
   Mokolodi Nature Reserve, Botswana, to study ecological effects of large
   herbivores on the small mammal community. Specifically, we attempted to
   answer the following questions: 1) are population sizes and community
   composition of small rodents affected by the exclusion of large
   herbivores?; 2) if so, what changes in the environment caused by the
   exclusion of large herbivores are related to changes in small mammal
   populations?; 3) in what way do such changes in the environment affect
   small mammals? The populations were significantly larger in the
   exclosures than in the control areas. A higher number of species was
   also found in the exclosures. it seems that the smaller populations of
   small mammals in areas with large herbivores are a result of a reduction
   in vegetation cover. In general, the exclosures had a higher grass cover
   than their paired controls. This same relation also held for percentage
   cover of litter and dead grass.},

Abstract = {Escaped hatchery rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), at
   post-smolt (120-340 g) and adult stages (800-3400 g) adapted differently
   to natural marine prey after escaping from two fish farms in northern
   Norway. About I month after escape (,July), more than 57\% of the
   post-smolt fed actively on fish larvae, which contributed 63-75\% of the
   diet by weight. Surface insects were consumed by more than half the
   post-smolts and represented 24-48\% of the diet during the 3-month
   period of sampling (June-August). One month after escaping, forage
   ratios (weight stomach/weight fish x 100) exceeded 1, similar to ratios
   recorded for other wild anadromous salmonid species in the area.
   Postsmolt weight increased during the sampling period and the condition
   factor was stable. In contrast, the condition factor of escaped adult
   fish reduced significantly and the forage ratios were consistently low
   (0.05-0.77) during the 15 months of sampling (March-August) following
   their escapement. These fish fed primarily on a variety of different
   indigestible items (especially particles of seaweed and small pieces of
   wood) that contributed about 70\% of the stomach content weight. They
   took fish larvae only in July. Although generally contributing little to
   their overall diet, marine prey of great variety was consumed by the
   adult fish. The results indicate that young domestic rainbow trout more
   easily adjust to natural feeding after escape than the older, larger
   fish, which often fed on indigestible items similar in shape to the
   commercial pellets to which they were accustomed. (c) 2005 International

Abstract = {The seasonal marine feeding pattern of sea trout was studied from March
   to December 2001 in two large fjords situated at latitudes 69 degrees N
   and 66 degrees N in the northern part of Norway. Despite low sea
   temperatures and high salinity, sea running trout were caught during all
   sampling occasions in both fjords. The trout had fed extensively oil
   marine crustaceans (shrimps, amphipods, and krill) and polychaetes
   during early and late winter, and had a stable or increasing condition
   factor during this period. In summer and autumn, the trout fed
   predominantly on fish, mainly juvenile herring. Food consumption rates
   were lowest during late autumn and early winter (October-December) in
   both fjords, while trout in the southernmost fjord had the highest
   consumption rates from April to August and trout in the northernmost
   fjord from May to September. These patterns in both fjords matched the
   seasonal variations in condition factor and relative lipid content of
   the fish during the same periods. The marine winter migration of these
   northern sea trout populations appears to be a feeding migration in
   which the fish maintain or increase their body condition, representing a
   previously undocumented alternative to the more common life history
   strategy of over-wintering and starvation in freshwater at the northern
   distribution of this species. (c) 2005 International Council for the

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation in length-at-age and environmental
   factors affecting variation in growth rate of juvenile Atlantic salmon
   Salmo salar were studied using data from a long-term study in the River
   Stjordalselva, central Norway. Mean annual instantaneous growth rate
   among 1+ and 2+year juvenile Atlantic salmon varied between 0.59 and
   1.50 g g(-1) year(-1) and mean instantaneous daily growth rate of
   young-of-the-year (YOY) varied between 0.013 and 0.033 g g(-1) day(-1).
   Between year variation in growth was larger than the within year
   intra-watercourse spatial variation. For YOY and 1+year Atlantic salmon,
   a major part of the observed between year variation in growth rates was
   explained by variation in mean daily water discharge and spring
   temperature. For 2+year juvenile Atlantic salmon, mean daily water
   discharge and cohort density were the only variables to significantly
   explain variation in growth rates. A large part of the within
   water-course spatial variation could not be explained by temperature
   variations and juvenile Atlantic salmon in the uppermost areas of the
   river, experiencing the lowest ambient temperatures during the growth
   period, displayed the highest growth rates. Within the baselines set by
   temperature, biotic and abiotic factors connected to water flow regime
   and variation in food availability are suggested to be a major
   determinants of the temporal and spatial variation in juvenile Atlantic
   salmon growth rates.},

Pages = {89-97},

Abstract = {Studies on the population status, distribution, and behaviour of puku
   (Kobus vardoni) on the floodplains along the Chobe river front were
   carried out from April 2001 to February 2003. The population of puku was
   believed to be in decline since the last census in 1965-1967, following
   profound habitat changes caused by an increase in elephants and other
   large herbivores in the area. Our study, however, showed a strong
   increase in numbers of puku compared to the 1960s. Concentration of the
   population had, however, shifted eastwards, possibly as a result of
   direct human disturbance in the western part of the riverfront. Puku
   mainly utilized floodplain habitat (91\% of sightings). The most common
   observation was of breeding herds (36\%) followed by adult males (26\%).
   Calving took place year round though with a peak in March/April.
   Although puku have increased in numbers along the Chobe River the
   population is small and isolated, and must be considered vulnerable.
   Apparently suitable habitats in the area, which today are little used by
   puku due to human disturbance, could again become important and allow
   the population to increase further, if disturbance could be reduced.},

Abstract = {Utilization by the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) of five tree
   species of different acceptability was assessed on trees used three
   years earlier in a simulated browsing experiment. The experiment
   included two levels of treatment, twig cutting and stem cutting, and

   fenced area, and there was no natural browsing by large herbivores.
   After three years, elephants broke into the area and their browsing of
   the experimental trees was assessed one month later. Four of the five
   species were browsed by the elephants, and for three of the species
   percentage utilization was higher on individuals subjected to simulated
   browsing three years before than on control trees. Treatment effects
   were strongest on the species intermediately used by the elephants.
   There was no difference in percentage utilization between trees with cut
   twigs and with cut stems. The results show that some aspect of the
   tree's response to a single browsing event is still discernible for the
   elephants after three years with protection from browsing.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {The maintenance of plumage color polymorphism ill the parasitic jaeger
   (Stecorarius parasiticus) is still not well understood. Earlier studies
   indicated that selection may favor pale females and melanic Males. If
   so, females would maximize their fitness, producing pale female and
   melanic male We therefore predicted that females might bias their
   Offspring sex ratio toward daughters ill pale pairs and toward sons in
   melanic pairs. Females might also choose to mate assortatively, in
   relation to plumage color, thereby maximizing the probability of
   producing either pale or melanic Offspring. Because fen ales are larger
   than males, differential rearing costs may affect the offspring sex
   ratio independent of parental plumage color. We examined offspring Sex
   ratio allocation, breeding variables indicative of parental quality, and
   mating pattern ill relation to plumage color ill a colony of parasitic
   jaegers in northern Norway Jaegers tended to Mate assortatively ill
   relation to plumage color. The reproductive performance declined with
   season, and matched pairs appeared to be of lower quality than mixed
   pairs. The proportion of male Offspring increased with hatching date in
   matched pale and mixed pairs, whereas the situation was reversed in
   matched melanic pairs. Matched pale pairs produced an overall surplus of
   favorable pale but costly daughters despite their lower quality, while
   melanic pairs produced a surplus Of favorable melanic Soils. However,
   differential offspring rearing costs and parental rearing capacity may
   have additionally affected the realized offspring sex ratio. Mixed pairs
   producing all overall surplus of pale and melanic daughters allocated
   their resources according to differential rearing costs and parental
   quality only We suggest that both strategies of sex ratio allocation
   together with differences in reproductive success ill matched versus
   Mixed pairs May have a balancing effect oil the mating pattern between
   plumage morphs and may contribute to the maintenance of the color
   polymorphism in this species.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {128},

Abstract = {Estimates of population size and density are essential for successful
   management and conservation of any species. Although there are a variety
   of methods available for estimating abundance and density of
   populations, most studies rely on only one estimator and very few
   studies have compared and critically evaluated the adequacy and the cost
   of these methods. We used the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in south-central
   Sweden to compare the performance of three different methods of
   estimating population size, including methods based on conventional
   field data as well as on non-invasive genetic data. The method based on
   observations of females with cubs underestimated the true population
   size, as the estimates were below the number of unique genotypes
   determined from faecal data inside the study area. The best traditional
   method was based on observations of bears from a helicopter. The genetic
   method using the closed population MARK estimator, as recommended in a
   previous study, seemed to perform the best. We conclude that
   approximately 223 (188-282) bears were present in our 7328 km(2) Study
   area during 2001 and 2002 and suggest that this hunted brown bear
   population has been relatively stable for about ten years. The
   non-invasive genetic method was less expensive than the most reliable
   traditional field method (a CMR method based on observations of bears
   from a helicopter), and preferable from an ethical point of view. We
   recommend that future studies using non-invasive genetic methods based
   on collected faecal samples should aim at collecting 2.5-3 times the
   number of faecal samples as the ``assumed{''} number of animals. (c)

Abstract = {While factors affecting body growth have been extensively studied, very
   little is known about the factors likely to affect the sexual size
   dimorphism (SSD) in polygynous mammals. Based oil the carcass mass of
   24420 male and female moose recorded in 14 Norwegian populations, we
   examine three hypotheses to explain geographical variation in SSD.
   First, SSD is expected to decrease when the relative density of animals
   (for a given habitat quality) increases, because resource limitation at
   high population densities is assumed to affect body growth of males more
   than females. Second, because males are selected to invest in growth
   more than females, environmental seasonality and related improvement of
   the forage quality during the short and intense growing season are
   expected to increase SSD. Third, by decreasing the proportion of adult
   males in the population, resulting in start of rutting earlier in life,
   hunting may decrease the SSD by increasing the reproductive cost of
   young males. We found that males grew faster and for a longer time of
   their life than did females and thus were heavier (-24\%) when they
   reached adulthood. Sexual size dimorphism was independent of density but
   was higher in areas with short growing seasons. The low SSD in
   populations with largely adult female-biased sex ratios (mates per
   female) shows that male body growth decreases, with a decreasing
   proportion of adult males in the population. Our results indicate that
   geographical variation in moose SSD is influenced by divergent responses
   in the sexes to ecological factors affecting body growth.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {57-65},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Parr of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) were exposed to constant or
   fluctuating water level and flow in artificial outdoor stream channels
   during 21 days in three consecutive runs, and their individual behaviour
   and social interactions were monitored. Despite the large variation in
   flow, no clear differences in growth, which was generally poor, and
   behaviour were found between treatments. The signs of a social structure
   in the stream channels were very subtle and there were no clear relation
   between growth rate and aggressive/dominant behaviour in any of the
   treatments in accordance with findings in studies of growth and
   dominance in the wild. Thus, in regulated rivers, daily fluctuations in
   flow and water level (hydropeaking) are not likely to alter the
   behaviour of juvenile brown trout or affect their energy turnover
   negatively. Several studies now indicate that if stranding can be
   avoided, hydropeaking has relatively small direct effects on stream
   salmonids. Therefore, future research should focus on cascading
   ecological effects that may influence the productivity of the ecosystems
   in regulated rivers.},

Abstract = {Based on the sexually selected infanticide (SSI) hypothesis, infanticide
   can be an adaptive mating strategy for males, but this is has rarely
   been documented in non-social mammals. This phenomenon should not
   benefit females, so one would expect females to evolve mating counter
   strategies in order to protect their infants from infanticidal males.
   Cases of SSI are extremely difficult to document in the field,
   especially for non-social species. Using field observations and genetic
   methods, we describe mating strategies employed by both sexes of brown
   bears (Ursus arctos) in relation to SSI. We present evidence for the
   first time suggesting that infanticide is an adaptive male mating
   strategy in this non-social carnivore, as all requirements for SSI are
   fulfilled (1) infanticide shortens the time to the mother's next estrus,
   (2) the perpetrator is not the father of the killed infants, and (3)
   putative perpetrators sire the next litter. Moreover, all infanticide
   cases occurred during the mating season. We expected that primarily
   immigrant males were infanticidal, as in social species. However, we
   found that resident adult males commonly committed infanticide. Perhaps
   they recognize females they have mated with previously. Moreover, we
   used DNA-based parentage testing to demonstrate a minimum of 14.5\% of
   multiple paternities (up to 28\% for litters with at least three young).
   Female promiscuity to confuse paternity may be an adaptive counter
   strategy to avoid infanticide.},

Abstract = {Combined analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci
   were performed to assess the genetic differentiation of two
   spring-spawning ciscoes from each other and from sympatric Coregonus
   albula in two German lakes. Polymorphism was screened at six
   microsatellite loci and mtDNA for a total of 247 and 94 ciscoes,
   respectively. Microsatellite data showed a weak differentiation between
   spring-spawning Coregonus fontanae and sympatric C. albula in Lake
   Stechlin (F-ST = 0-0(.)008), whereas a significant differentiation was
   observed between spring-spawning Coregonus lucinensis and sympatric C.
   albula in Lake Breiter Luzin (F-ST = 0(.)013-0(.)039). A more pronounced
   genetic difference was observed between both spring-spawning species
   (F-ST = 0(.)05-0(.)128). Shared mtDNA haplotypes among sympatric species
   within both Lake Stechlin and Lake Breiter Luzin were observed, whereas
   no haplotype was shared between C. fontanae and C. lucinensis. These
   results suggest an independent origin for spring-spawning ciscoes in
   each lake. Evidence is also provided for mtDNA introgression of
   Coregonus sardinella into C. lucinensis and C. albula in Lake Breiter
   Luzin. Postglacially, this species or at least a population which showed
   mtDNA introgression has colonized the Baltic Sea basin up to the glacial
   margin that was located between Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin. (c)

Abstract = {Sea running Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus and anadromous brown trout
   (sea trout)Salmo trutta(420-2030 g) tagged with externally attached data
   storage tags (DST) had a higher total recapture rate (39 of 44, 89\%)
   due to entanglement in bag nets at sea (90\% of all recaptures),
   compared with internally tagged fish (12 of 18, 67\%) that were mostly
   trapped when returning to their home river (75\% of all recaptures). The
   internally tagged fishes therefore spent longer time at sea before
   recapture (median 33 days) than externally tagged fishes (median 8
   days), and more DST-data were collected. Therefore, in areas with high
   net fishing intensity, external tagging increases the chances of
   recapture, but less data may then be recorded by the tags due to a
   generally shorter period of data sampling. (c) 2006 The Authors Journal

Abstract = {Depredation on livestock is one of the main conflicts associated with
   Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx conservation in Norway. Our study investigates
   how Eurasian lynx utilise high-density patches of free-ranging and
   unguarded livestock (domestic sheep Ovis aries and semi-domestic
   reindeer Rangifer tarandus) as compared to patches associated with
   low-density wild ungulate prey, roe deer Capreolus capreolus. We
   monitored 10 radio-collared lynx in central Norway in two seasons that
   differed in ungulate distribution and density. According to the `optimal
   foraging theory' an animal should preferentially utilise areas with more
   abundant food if not constrained by other factors; therefore we
   predicted that lynx should select patches containing livestock. Contrary
   to our prediction the results indicate no selection for livestock
   patches in any season. In contrast, a clear preference was shown for roe
   deer patches in both seasons. Our findings support the hypothesis that
   lynx depredation on livestock seems to be affected by chance encounter
   rates, rather than by active selection for livestock-dense patches. We
   conclude that habitat selection by lynx seemed to be governed by a
   number of other factors than food alone, and that lynx predation on
   livestock, especially on sheep, should not be regarded as being
   ecologically equivalent to predation on wild prey.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The chiru or Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsoni has dramatically
   decreased in number over recent decades, and efficient monitoring of the
   density and distribution of chiru is vital to the management of this
   endangered species. We evaluated line transect sampling methodology,
   using track and cross-county transects, and assessed its conformity to
   underlying assumptions for use in estimating density of chiru in the ca
   2,300 km(2) Aru Basin, Tibet. Although violations of some assumptions
   were apparent, they were generally not substantial, and simple
   adjustments of sampling design can reduce their effects in future
   surveys. Sampling effort was not sufficient to demonstrate clear
   seasonal differences in chiru density between summer and autumn.
   However, cross-country transects on the west side of the study area did
   show a statistically significant higher autumn than summer density, and
   encounter rates (the number of detections per km) were significantly
   higher for both transect types in autumn. We tested for an expected
   negative bias associated with track transects, and although a clear
   difference in estimated density was not found, a significantly higher
   encounter rate was present for cross-country than for track transects.
   With increased sampling effort and a more effective design in future
   surveys, line transect sampling will be a useful methodology for
   assessment of chiru populations.},

Title = {Risk of capture-related mortality in large free-ranging mammals:
   experiences from Scandinavia},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-113},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Chemical capture and anaesthesia of free-ranging mammals will always
   involve some risk of mortality even in healthy animals. Deaths may be
   directly or indirectly attributable to the anaesthetic event itself
   (e.g. drug overdose, drowning during induction and dart trauma) or may
   be caused by secondary effects from the capture (e.g. stress, myopathy,
   trauma or instrumentation with radio-transmitters). In long-term
   research projects on five major wildlife species in Scandinavia, the
   capture-related mortality rates (number of captures) were: moose Alces
   alces 0.7\% (N = 2,816), brown bears Ursus arctos 0.9\% (N = 1,079),
   wolverines Gulo gulo 2.8\% (N = 461), Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx 3.9\% (N =
   380), and gray wolves Canis lupus 3.4\% (N = 89). We suggest that
   wildlife professionals should strive for a zero mortality rate but adopt
   the standard that a mortality rate of > 2\% probably should not be
   accepted in any large mammalian species. This can be achieved by: 1)
   using an experienced professional capture team, 2) developing and
   following a capture protocol specific to each species, and 3) requiring
   that a mortality assessment be undertaken after any capture-related
   death. This assessment should re-evaluate the capture protocol,
   including how changes in anaesthetics and methodological approaches
   could have prevented the mortality.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sexual selection predicts that males should signal their viability and
   health and this is often achieved with elaborate ornaments. However,
   females' phenotypic and genotypic quality may also be related to
   ornamental expression. We investigated the association between a female
   ornamental trait (white wing plumage) and female quality in the common
   eider, Somateria mollissima. Only females incubate and care for young,
   so male parental effort did not influence the females' condition, and
   the ornament is expressed only in females, so it is not a neutral
   correlated response to selection of the same ornament in males. We
   recorded the expression of this ornament in relation to the number of
   eggs laid and to mass loss and immunological status during incubation.
   Females that experienced a large mass loss and/or a reduction in immune
   cell levels (immunosuppression) had less white in the new wing bands
   produced after breeding. These results are the first to show a
   correlation between tolerance of reproductive costs and the expression
   of a strictly female ornament in a species with conventional sex roles.

Abstract = {Pelagic crustacean zooplankton were collected from 336 Norwegian lakes
   covering a wide range of latitude, altitude, lake area, mean depth,
   production (as chlorophyll a), and fish community structure. Mean
   zooplankton species richness during the ice-free season was generally
   low at high latitudes and altitudes. Further, lower species richness was
   recorded in western lakes, possibly reflecting constraints on migration
   and dispersal. However, despite obvious spatial limitations, geographic
   boundaries were only weak predictors of mean zooplankton richness.
   Similarly, lake surface area did not contribute positively to mean
   richness such as seen in other ecosystem surveys. Rather, intrinsic
   factors such as primary production and fish community (planktivore)
   structure were identified by regression analysis as the major predictors
   of zooplankton diversity, while a positive correlation was observed
   between species richness and total zooplankton biomass. However, in
   spite of a large number of variables included in this study, the
   predictive power of multiple regression models was modest (< 50\%
   variance explained), pointing to a major role for within-lake
   properties, as yet unidentified intrinsic forces, stochasticity, or
   dispersal as constraints on zooplankton diversity in these lakes.},

Title = {Modelling behavioural and fitness consequences of disturbance for geese
   along their spring flyway},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {1. For migratory birds the implications of environmental change may be
   difficult to predict because they use multiple sites during their annual
   cycle. Moreover, the migrants' use of these sites may be interdependent.
   Along the flyway of the Svalbard pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus
   population, Norwegian farmers use organized scaring to minimize goose
   use of their grasslands in spring. We assessed the consequences of this
   practice for regional site use of pink-footed geese along their spring
   migration route.
   2. We used dynamic programming to find the sequence of migratory
   decisions that maximizes the fitness of female geese during spring
   migration, assuming scaring impinges on both food-intake rates and
   predation risk. The parameterization of the model was based on data
   gathered from individually marked pink-footed geese between 1991 and
   2003.
   3. The effect of scaring in terms of fitness and site use was most
   noticeable regarding food-intake rate. Scaring resulted in a
   redistribution of geese along the flyway. Furthermore, the outcomes of
   the modelling exercises were highly dependent on whether or not the
   geese were omniscient or naive: at moderate scaring levels naive geese
   were predicted to succumb.
   4. On a qualitative basis there was good correspondence between the
   predictions from the model and the empirical evidence gathered to date.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Besides highlighting the importance of
   learning and changing behaviour in an adaptive fashion, our modelling
   exercise indicated the potential vulnerability of the geese to abrupt
   environmental change. In addition, the exercise emphasized the
   interdependence of site use along the migratory flyway. The model
   supports the necessity for an integrated flyway management approach. In
   Norway, discussion is ongoing about the future management of the spring
   conflict between farming interests and geese. Farmers in north and
   mid-Norway have announced that they will expand the scaring campaign if
   a long-term solution, including a compensation scheme, is not
   forthcoming. If scaring on such a large scale is implemented abruptly,
   it may have severe consequences for the population: management of both
   the scaring intensity and its geographical extent is urgently required.},

Abstract = {We Studied reproduction of 56 female wolverines (Gulo gulo) in 2 areas
   of northern Scandinavia. Minimum average age at 1st reproduction was 3.4
   years. Mean proportion of females (>= 3 years old) reproducing was 0.53
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.43-0.63, n = 94), and the annual
   mean was 0.58 (95\% Cl = 0.35-0.80, n = 83). Mean annual birth rate was
   0.74 (95\% Cl = 0.33-1.14, n = 83) young per female (>= 3 years old).
   Mean size of 74 litters was 1.88 (95\% Cl = 1.68-2.07, range = 1-4).
   Examination Of Our data Suggests that female wolverines have low
   productivity and low capacity to compensate for increased mortality.
   Therefore, wildlife managers Should consider wolverine demographics,
   especially mortality of adult female wolverines, when developing and
   implementing conservation policies and harvest regulations.},

Title = {New protected areas in Norway: Local participation without gender
   equality},
Journal = {MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-54},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In Norway, as in many other countries, new protected areas are currently
   being established and managed with strong policy references to ``local
   participation.{''} Is this policy implemented in a way that incorporates
   the concern for gender equality? The present article provides data from
   a study of 2 cases in which new protected areas have recently been
   established. The first is the Dovre Mountains Conservation Plan
   (Verneplan for Dovrefjell), which was adopted in 2002 and includes
   Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park. In the second case, the focus
   is on an area which was established in 2004 as the Geiranger-Herdalen
   Landscape Protected Area (landskapsvernomrade). It is argued that one
   could expect Norway-perhaps more than any other country-to implement
   local participation in protected area establishment in a way that
   ensures gender equality. However, the results of the study show that
   local participation within the context of conservation issues ignores
   policies and legislation on gender equality. These findings are analyzed
   and causes for this state of affairs are shown to reside in structural
   features on the one hand, and the lack of demand for female candidates
   in local elections and appointments on the other. It is concluded that
   the main factor explaining this situation is neglect by Norwegian
   conservation authorities of their responsibility for gender
   mainstreaming. Efforts to legitimate conservation with reference to
   local participation are seen as problematical when local women are
   involved only to a very limited extent.},

Abstract = {Teeth are vital for mammal performance and especially in ungulates
   relying on mechanical decomposition of plant material for effective
   microbial digestion and energy uptake. The main focus of the role of
   teeth in ungulate life histories has been on tooth wear, while no one
   has addressed to what extent deviation from the natural set of teeth
   (maldentition) causes variation in individual fitness components. Based
   on mandibles from 41,066 individual red deer (Cervus elaphus L.)
   collected from 1969 to 2001, we tested whether maldentition had an
   effect on individual body condition and whether this effect depended on
   environmental harshness. Females with maldentition (0.6\% of the
   population) were in a poorer condition than individuals without tooth
   anomalies and the effect increased during unfavorable climatic
   conditions. The effect of maldentition in males was less clear. This
   study indicates that a well-functioning set of teeth is essential for
   mammal performance, and that selection pressure against (dental)
   anomalies is more pronounced when climate is unfavorable.},

Abstract = {In a series of environmentally realistic laboratory experiments,
   toxicokinetics and effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were
   studied in the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Winter fasting and
   emaciation, which are common among Arctic charr living in high
   latitudes, resulted in a redistribution of the lipophilic PCBs from
   lipid-storing tissue such as the muscle, to vital organs that must be
   considered sensitive toward PCB ( liver and brain). This redistribution
   was accompanied by a significant potentiation of the hepatic cytochrome
   P-450 (CYP) 1A biomarker response, from low activities in October (
   within those measured in uncontaminated charr) to a high, probably
   maximum, induction in May. Performance studies demonstrated a clear
   effect of environmentally realistic PCB levels on endocrine mechanisms,
   immune function, and seawater preadaptation ( smoltification) in charr
   that had been feed deprived for several months after contamination with
   Aroclor 1254, whereas a high PCB dose exerted only minor, if any,
   effects in charr that had been fed after contamination. These results
   demonstrate that emaciation results in decreased dose-response
   relationships in fish, and indicate that arctic animals undergoing
   seasonal cycles of ``fattening{''} and emaciation may be extra sensitive
   toward persistent, lipophilic organochlorines. Pilot studies on Arctic
   charr from Bjornoya Island revealed marked CYP1A biomarker responses and
   an upregulation of genes involved in cellular homeostatic mechanisms in
   charr from Lake Ellasjoen ( high PCB levels).},

Abstract = {Since different organochlorine contaminants (OCs) are often highly
   correlated in biota, a major challenge in observational field studies is
   to establish whether some OCs are potentially important causative agents
   of adverse effects. A possible solution to this problem is to compare
   the strength of the effects of different OCs on a number of outcome
   parameters, and then examine if some compounds are more consistently
   reliable predictors of adverse effects. In this analysis the four most
   common OCs ( hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB], oxychlordane, p,
   p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene{[} DDE], and polychlorinated
   biphenyls {[}PCBs]) in arctic glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) were
   ranked in relation to 19 different outcome parameters, for which at
   least 1 of the 4 OCs were significantly related. PCBs, made up close to
   75\% of the measured Sigma OCs, DDE 17 - 18\%, and HCB and oxychlordane
   3 - 4\%, respectively. Despite relatively low levels of oxychlordane and
   HCB, these compounds tended to be more reliable predictors of adverse
   effects and were ranked highest for 11 and 10 of the 19 outcome
   parameters, respectively. PCBs and DDE were only ranked highest for
   seven of the outcome parameters. Oxychlordane, HCB, DDE, and PCB were
   ``not significant{''} two, six, six, and eight times, respectively.
   Oxychlordane was significantly more likely to be related to adverse
   effects than DDE. Even if effects of OCs may depend on a complex
   interaction between different compounds, this analysis indicates that
   adverse effects are more likely to occur in glaucous gulls with
   relatively high concentrations of oxychlordane and HCB.},

   and 2004. All geese staged in the Trondheim Fjord area, mid Norway, for
   2-3 weeks before onward migration to Vesteralen, north Norway, where
   average arrival and departure dates were 10 and 17 May 2003 and 15 and
   19 May 2004. Average staging period in Vesteralen of satellite tagged
   geese was 4-6 days. No staging areas were identified between Vesteralen
   and Svalbard. Average arrival dates in Svalbard were 22 May 2003 and 21
   May 2004. On arrival to Svalbard geese staged in southwestern coastal
   areas of Spitsbergen (n = 5) and around IsfJord, central Spitsbergen (n
   = 6), areas which tend to thaw early in spring. Geese staged on average
   at two staging areas before I June during a total staging period of
   about 8 days. First egg dates in the two years in Sassendalen, central
   Spitsbergen, were mainly between 26 and 31 May, so tagged geese should
   have arrived at their breeding areas before I June. Therefore, rapid
   follicular development must be initiated in Vesteralen, confirmed by
   observations of oocyte development in birds shot on arrival in Svalbard.
   A pre-nesting increase in male abdominal profile indices in Svalbard
   indicates income feeding as a supplement to the capital invested in
   follicular growth on migration. We here present the first and most
   comprehensive study on the distribution of pre-nesting sites on Svalbard
   and staging periods of the geese. Such habitats can have a substantial
   influence on the reproductive success.},

Abstract = {The feeding behaviour of Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus was
   studied in Adventdalen, Svalbard, during 15-28 May 2004 to determine
   habitat use of newly arrived birds based on their distribution in
   relation to the major vegetation types present. Goose numbers increased
   from initial arrival on 15 May to 380-440 during 23-28 May, with a brief
   arrival peak of 990 on 20 May. Geese fed initially on grass-rich
   communities associated with gravel out-wash fans, but shifted to wet
   meadow habitats as the thaw progressed, and increasingly used moss
   tundra and heath habitats after 22 May. Less than 20\% of observed geese
   fed by grubbing the substrate prior to 21 May, but more than 85\% did so
   from 24 May onwards as rising air temperatures exceeded freezing point
   and the substrate progressively thawed, permitting excavation of
   subterranean plant storage organs. This pattern was reflected in the
   diet based on examination of epidermal fragments in the droppings, which
   showed geese initially fed on above ground dead material from the
   previous growing season (most abundant in the productive out-wash fans).
   However, as the substrate thawed, from 22 May geese fed increasingly on
   the more nutritious Equisetum spp. and finally on below-ground storage
   organs of Bistorta viviparum as these became available with substrate
   thaw. The implications of these changes are discussed in the context of
   the energetic implications for arriving birds and their subsequent
   reproductive output.},

Title = {Nutrient dynamics of reindeer forage species along snowmelt gradients at
   different ecological scales},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-30},
Abstract = {Growing season nutrient dynamics of four reindeer forage species (Betula
   nana, Eriophorum angustifolium, Rumex acetosa and Vaccinium myrtillus)
   were studied in a mountainous sub-arctic landscape in N Sweden. Changes
   in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and fibre (ADF) concentrations in
   {[}eaves and shoots were analysed (from a reindeer foraging perspective)
   along four ecological gradients significant to regional and local
   snowmelt regimes: season, oceanicity, attitude, and snow-patch retreat.
   N and P concentrations showed marked seasonal variations with peaks
   occurring from the middle of June to the end of July depending on
   species and snowmelt progression. The seasonal pattern for ADF
   concentrations, as well as differences between snowmelt regimes, were
   less consistent and showed large differences between species. N
   concentrations increased along snowmelt gradients at small (within
   snow-patches) and medium (along attitude gradients) spatial scales.
   Furthermore, variations in N concentrations were temporally and
   spatially scale-dependent, which underlines the importance of scale for
   understanding plant nutrient dynamics in sub-arctic and alpine systems,
   as well for plant-animal interactions. The greatest temporal and spatial
   differences in nutrient quality were observed early in the season, i.e.,
   at the time of highest nutrient requirements for reindeer.
   Climate-induced changes of the start and the progress of the growing
   season may result in significant consequences to the development of
   calves and subsequently to the population demography of reindeer,
   mediated through spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of
   high quality food. These results provide basic knowledge for reindeer
   management in the tight of the ongoing global warming. (C) 2005

Abstract = {Species diversity, host specificity and species turnover among
   phytophagous beetles were studied in the canopy of two tropical lowland
   forests in Panama with the use of canopy cranes. A sharp rainfall
   gradient occurs between the two sites located 80 km apart. The wetter
   forest is located in San Lorenzo Protected Area on the Caribbean side of
   the isthmus, and the drier forest is a part of the Parque Natural
   Metropolitano close to Panama City on the Pacific slope. Host
   specificity was measured as effective specialization and recorded by
   probability methods based on abundance categories and feeding records
   from a total of 102 species of trees and lianas equally distributed
   between the two sites. The total material collected included more than
   65,000 beetles of 2462 species, of which 306 species were shared between
   the two sites. The wet forest was 37\% more species rich than the dry
   forest due to more saproxylic species and flower visitors. Saproxylic
   species and flower visitors were also more host-specific in the wet
   forest. Leaf chewers showed similar levels of species richness and host
   specificity in both forests. The effective number of specialized species
   per plant species was higher in the wet forest. Higher levels of local
   alpha- and beta-diversity as well as host specificity based on present
   data from a tropical wet forest, suggests higher number of species at
   regional levels, a result that may have consequences for ecological
   estimates of global species richness.},

Journal = {IBIS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {148},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Norwegian Greylag Goose Anser anser population has been increasing
   steadily over the past few decades, causing increasing nuisance in terms
   of agricultural crop damage. This, in combination with the importance of
   Greylags as a hunting target, has called for demographic estimates for
   the population to assist in management decisions. To this end, we
   analysed long-term mark-recapture data using Cormack-Jolly-Seber models
   embedded in program MARK to obtain survival estimates for the
   population. No sex-specific difference, or age effect on survival after
   juveniles had completed their first migration (3 months of age), was
   evident. Mean first-year survival was reported as 0.485 and annual
   survival of older birds as 0.700. On a monthly basis, survival in
   Greylags during summer and winter was very similar over the study
   period. A significant linear decline in winter survival from 0.909 to
   0.807 was, however, apparent during the study period. Over the second
   half of the study (1994-2002), summer survival was about 3\% lower than
   in the first half (1986-94) but no linear relationship was evident. We
   found a significant inverse relationship between Greylag survival during
   summer and latitudinal distribution in Norway. A similar relationship
   was evident between survival and annual bag numbers. The changes in
   adult survival observed in this study are likely to have had a
   substantial impact on the growth rate of the Norwegian Greylag
   population.},

Title = {Carotenoid coloration in great black-backed gull Larus marinus reflects
   individual quality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-12},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Carotenoids are a large group of biochemicals, with similar properties,
   synthesised by bacteria, fungi, algae and plants. Vertebrates obtain
   these biologically active pigments through the diet, and they are a
   disproportionately common component of animal colour signals and play
   important roles in immune functions and as antioxidants. Carotenoids are
   believed to be a limited resource and because of the trade-off between
   allocation of carotenoids to signals and to other functions, carotenoid
   based signals are often thought to be handicap signals. The purpose of
   this study was to investigate the signalling potential of
   carotenoid-based tissue coloration in the great black-backed gull Larus
   marinus. The intensity of carotenoid-based coloration in bill, gape and
   eye-ring coloration was investigated in relation to body condition,
   reproductive parameters, levels of immune activity, and sexual
   dimorphism. In males there was a positive relationship between colour
   intensity and body condition, but in females no such relationship was
   found. However, females with high colour intensity had larger eggs and
   clutches. Additionally, females with high red scores tended to have high
   density of circulating lymphocytes. There was no sexual dimorphism in
   coloration and there was a negative relationship between colour
   intensity and sampling time, which indicates that this coloration is
   most intensely expressed early in the breeding season. The results in
   this study suggest that carotenoid-based coloration in great
   black-backed gull are partly condition dependent and reveal information
   about individual quality in both males an females. Hence, it might have
   evolved as an important signal for assessing the quality of potential
   mates.},

Abstract = {This study was designed to determine the spring, summer, autumn, and
   early winter distribution, migration routes, and timing of migration of
   the Atlantic population of Steller's eiders Polysticta stelleri.
   Satellite transmitters were implanted in 20 eiders captured in April
   2001 at Vadso, Norway, and their locations were determined from 5 May
   2001 to 6 February 2002. Regions where birds concentrated from spring
   until returning to wintering areas included coastal waters from western
   Finnmark, Norway, to the eastern Taymyr Peninsula, Russia. Novaya
   Zemlya, Russia, particularly the Mollera Bay region, was used
   extensively during spring staging, moult, and autumn staging; regions of
   the Kola, Kanin, and Gydanskiy peninsulas, Russia, were used extensively
   during spring and moult migrations. Steller's ciders migrated across the
   Barents and Kara seas and along the Kara Sea and Kola Peninsula coastal
   waters to nesting, moulting, and wintering areas. The majority of marked
   eiders (9 of 15) were flightless in near-shore waters along the west
   side of Novaya Zemlya. Eiders were also flightless in northern Norway
   and along the Kanin and at Kola Peninsula coasts. We compare and
   contrast natural history characteristics of the Atlantic and Pacific
   populations and discuss evolutionary and ecological factors influencing
   their distribution.},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Three field-identified whitefish Coregonus lavaretus forms in Lake
   Muddusjarvi, Finland, were compared in morphology, diet and prey size.
   First, these forms were studied with univariate and multivariate
   analysis to assess morphological divergence at a higher resolution level
   than in the field. Second, stomach contents were analysed to estimate
   diet-overlap among forms. Finally, the relationship between prey size
   and morphology was examined. The whitefish were assigned to the initial
   field-classification with 99.2\% and 98.8\% accuracy for morphologic and
   meristic traits, respectively. The small sparsely-rakered form (SSR) had
   the shortest rakers and largest gillraker space, followed by the large
   sparsely-rakered form (LSR) with intermediate gillraker length and
   gillraker space, while densely-rakered whitefish (DR) had the longest
   rakers and smallest gillraker space. The two sparsely-rakered whitefish
   forms (LSR and SSR), consumed mainly benthic macroinvertebrates, while
   densely-rakered whitefish (DR), utilized pelagic food items. Average
   diet-overlaps between whitefish forms were low in June-September
   (Schoener's alpha = 0.02 - 0.23). Gillraker number and length were
   negatively correlated to prey length in the diet (r = -0.73, and r =
   -0.60), while gillraker space was positively correlated with prey length
   (r = 0.81). The fact that these whitefish forms were morphologically and
   ecologically segregated, and that gillraker traits probably have a
   functional value in food selection, further suggests that natural
   selection has been important in structuring life-history trajectories
   into divergent niche use. (c) 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British

Title = {Evaluation of three telemetry transmitter attachment methods for female
   silver-phase American eels (Anguilla rostrata Lesueur)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {502-511},
Abstract = {Declines in juvenile American eel (Anguilla rostrata Lesueur) abundance
   have led to concern about the impacts of anthropogenic structures on eel
   migration patterns. Telemetry provides an insightful tool for examining
   the movements of eels around these structures. Although there have been
   a number of studies investigating movements of Anguillid eels, using a
   variety of transmitter attachment techniques, there are few published
   evaluations of the effects of various tag attachment procedures. Hence,
   the effects of three telemetry attachment procedures were evaluated for
   female silver phase American eels. Short-term effects were examined by
   comparing the swimming performance of control eels and surgical shams
   with the swimming capacity of eels tagged externally, internally, and
   gastrically 24-hours following surgeries. Adaptive effects were
   investigated using a second swim trial 8 to 10 weeks following surgical
   procedures. Additionally, 12-week transmitter retention rates were
   calculated for each attachment method. Critical swimming velocity was
   not significantly different between treatments (P > 0.05), but did
   decrease significantly between trials (P = 0.012), suggesting that the
   swimming capacity of silver-phase American eels is not affected by the
   presence of telemetry transmitters or the method of transmitter
   attachment, even though swim performance decreases. However, transmitter
   retention rates varied considerably after the 12-week experimental
   period. Three gastric tags were regurgitated for a 12-week retention
   rate of 72.7\%. No surgically implanted transmitters were shed, while 11
   out of 12 externally affixed transmitters were lost, resulting in a
   retention rate of only 9.1\%. These results suggest that surgically
   implanting transmitters is the preferred method of affixing telemetry
   transmitters to American eels especially for long-term telemetry
   studies.},

Abstract = {Conflicts over conservation are often regarded as dichotomies of
   diametrical opposites. When national parks are established in Norway,
   two stereotypes can be sketched: (1) the ecocentric position valuing
   `pure, authentic nature', relying on the national government as the only
   acceptable decision and management level; and (2) a more anthropocentric
   position valuing cultural landscape elements and certain traditional and
   future uses of the area, favouring local management. A conflict over
   restoring a. ring range to a state of `authentic nature' for future
   designation as a national park is examined. The case has raised
   comprehensive local debate. It is asked whether the relevant actors
   should be seen as situated in the stereotypes, or whether a more complex
   three-dimensional picture would provide a better interpretation.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2006},

Pages = {271-295},
Abstract = {Cetacean-habitat modeling, although still in the early stages of
   development, represents a potentially powerful tool for predicting
   cetacean distributions and understanding the ecological processes
   determining these distributions. Marine ecosystems vary temporally on
   diel to decadal scales and spatially on scales from several meters to
   1000s of kilometers. Many cetacean species are wide-ranging and respond
   to this variability by changes in distribution patterns.
   Cetacean-habitat models have already been used to incorporate this
   variability into management applications, including improvement of
   abundance estimates, development of marine protected areas, and
   understanding cetacean-fisheries interactions. We present a review of
   the development of cetacean-habitat models, organized according to the
   primary steps involved in the modeling process. Topics covered include
   purposes for which cetacean-habitat models are developed, scale issues
   in marine ecosystems, cetacean and habitat data collection, descriptive
   and statistical modeling techniques, model selection, and model
   evaluation. To date, descriptive statistical techniques have been used
   to explore cetacean-habitat relationships for selected species in
   specific areas; the numbers of species and geographic areas examined
   using computationally intensive statistic modeling techniques are
   considerably less, and the development of models to test specific
   hypotheses about the ecological processes determining cetacean
   distributions has just begun. Future directions in cetacean-habitat
   modeling span a wide range of possibilities, from development of basic
   modeling techniques to addressing important ecological questions.},

Abstract = {Farmed salmon strains have been selected to improve growth rates as well
   as other traits of commercial interest but the 2 million farmed salmon
   escaping annually may enhance the risk of extinction of wild populations
   through genetic and ecological interactions. Here, we compare the
   transcription profiles of 3557 genes in the progeny of farmed and wild
   Atlantic salmon from Norway and Canada grown in controlled conditions,
   and demonstrate that five to seven generations of artificial selection
   led to heritable changes in gene transcription profiles, the average
   magnitude of the differences being 25\% and 18\% for at least 1.4\% and
   1.7\% of the expressed genes in juvenile salmon from Norway and Canada,
   respectively. Moreover, genes showing significant transcription profile
   differences in both farmed strains (16\%) all exhibited parallel
   changes. These findings, along with the identification of several genes
   whose expression profiles were modified through artificial selection,
   provide new insights into the molecular basis of parallel evolution, and
   suggest how gene flow from farmed escapees may affect the genetic
   integrity of wild populations.},

Pages = {73-82},

Abstract = {Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) living in allopatry in lakes often show
   a distinct size dimorphism where the large char prey upon small char. We
   studied the relationship between size scaling of energy intake, total
   metabolic costs and levels of storage energy related to the niche shift
   from invertebrate feeding to cannibalism in an alpine Arctic char
   population. Gill-net samples consisted of two distinct size modes, small
   invertebrate feeding char (92-172 mm total length) and large
   cannibalistic char (265-606 mm total length). Food consumption was
   estimated for a one year period using a radioactive tracer (Cs-137). The
   energy intake followed a hump-shaped relationship with fish size for
   invertebrate feeding char and increased monotonically with size for
   cannibalistic char. Total metabolic costs increased exponentially with
   size for both groups. Char feeding in the invertebrate niche had a
   maximum net energy gain at 140 mm total length with an upper size limit
   for positive net energy gain at 180 mm. For cannibals the relationship
   between size and net energy gain formed a hump shaped function with
   maximum net energy gain at 400 mm and a lower size limit for positive
   net energy gain at 230 mm. The size at maturation for both small and
   large char was close to the size for maximum energy gain in their
   respective niches. Immature individuals close to the upper size limit
   for positive net energy gain in the invertebrate niche had low levels of
   storage lipids but tended to have high mass specific growth rates. This
   may imply a reallocation from reversible (stored) energy to structural
   (length) growth as a strategy to transform into the size-range where the
   cannibalistic niche successfully could be exploited.},

Title = {Effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on nitrogen fixation in arctic

Abstract = {Recent global climate models predict a further significant loss of ozone
   in the next decades, with up to 50\% depletion of the ozone layer over
   large parts of the Arctic resulting in an increase in ultraviolet-B
   radiation (UV-B) (280-315 nm) reaching the surface of the Earth. The
   percentage of total annual ecosystem N input due to biological nitrogen
   fixation by cyanobacteria might be as high as 80\% and the contribution
   to total annual N uptake by plants up to 20\%. A possible reduction of
   nitrogen fixation raises serious concerns about already nutrient
   impoverished plant communities. This review shows that nitrogen fixation
   by moss-associated cyanobacteria in arctic vegetation was dramatically
   reduced after six years of exposure to enhanced UV-B radiation. In
   subarctic vegetation, nitrogen fixation activity of moss-associated
   cyanobacteria was not affected by 6 years of enhanced UV-B radiation.
   However, a 50\% increase of summer precipitation resulted in a 5- to
   6-fold increase in activity. Long-term effects of UV-B radiation on
   nitrogen fixation activity have been examined only in two lichens,
   giving contrasting results. Peltigera aphthosa (L.) Willd., having
   external cephalodia, experienced a significant reduction, whereas
   Peltigera didactyla (With.) J.R. Laudon, having cyanobacteria in the
   photobiont layer below the upper cortex, did not experience any changes
   due to radiation regimes. The difference is probably related to the
   location of the cyanobacteria. While the Nostoc cells are protected by
   the fungal, melanized upper cortex in P. didactyla, they are exposed and
   unprotected in P. aphthosa, and their own synthesis of UV-B absorbing
   compounds appears to be low. Under certain environmental conditions, an
   increasing UV-B radiation will dramatically affect nitrogen fixation in
   arctic tundra vegetation, which in turn may have severe influence on the
   nitrogen budget in these environments. Further long-term studies are
   necessary to conclude if these effects are temporal and how concurrent
   climatic changes will influence the nitrogen balance of the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {The behaviour of active male roe deer Caprealus caprealus Linnaeus, 1758
   was studied in a wild population on Storfosna island (Norway), during
   the pre-territorial and territorial seasons (February-August) of 1994.
   Observed behaviours were grouped in seven categories (mating,
   aggression, display, marking, vigilance, moving and maintenance), and
   the proportion of time spent in each behaviour by three age classes
   (yearlings, subadults and adults) was compared. Time spent in each
   behaviour varied significantly between months for all male age classes.
   From February to August, time spent in maintenance decreased, while time
   spent in vigilance increased. The time spent in mating increased both in
   adult and subadults but did not vary significantly for yearlings
   throughout the months. When comparing age classes within a month, there
   were no significant differences in time spent in each behaviour.
   Surprisingly, adult territorial males did not invest significantly more
   time in mating, with respect to yearlings and subadults. This may be
   consistent with the oligogynous mating system of roe deer, in which the
   reproductive success is divided amongst several years and their
   territoriality, which could be a tactic to reduce the competition for
   mating.},

Abstract = {Animals' habitat choices are often difficult to evaluate in nature due
   to the influence of various environmental factors, including human
   impact. In the present study we evaluate how such impacts influence
   habitat selection and local distribution of pink-footed geese Anser
   brachyrhynchus staging in Northern Norway during spring. In recent
   years, geese have been scared by farmers who protect their cultivated
   properties. We identified and classified various habitats by satellite
   images and field survey. Comparing data gathered in years before and
   during periods of intensive scaring enable us to evaluate how such
   disturbance influences habitat selection in geese. The scaring
   activities were recognised at three levels; no scaring, occasional
   scaring and intensive scaring, the latter representing repeated scaring
   during the complete 24 h cycle. Based on area estimations of the various
   habitat types in each scaring category, it appeared that the farmers
   primarily protected habitats of highest quality and, as a consequence.
   geese were more frequently registered at less productive habitats. This
   represents a contrast to the undisturbed situation some years earlier,
   where geese distributed evenly on the various field habitats. If the
   future agricultural policy continues towards an increased intensive
   agricultural practice, farmers may carry on to protect their intensively
   managed fields and geese will be banished to less productive farmland.
   Such polarisation will eventually reduce the carrying capacity for
   geese, creating a situation where they are unable to move freely to
   exploit resources of crucial importance for migration and reproduction.

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Kin-related social structure may influence reproductive success and
   survival and, hence, the dynamics of populations. It has been documented
   in many gregarious animal populations, but few solitary species. Using
   molecular methods and field data we tested: (1) whether kin-related
   spatial structure exists in the brown bear (Ursus arctos), which is a
   solitary carnivore, (2) whether home ranges of adult female kin overlap
   more than those of nonkin, and (3) whether multigenerational matrilinear
   assemblages, i.e., aggregated related females, are formed. Pairwise
   genetic relatedness between adult (5 years and older) female dyads
   declined significantly with geographic distance, whereas this was not
   the case for male-male dyads or opposite sex dyads. The amount of
   overlap of multiannual home ranges was positively associated with
   relatedness among adult females. This structure within matrilines is
   probably due to kin recognition. Plotting of multiannual home-range
   centers of adult females revealed formation of two types of matrilines,
   matrilinear assemblages exclusively using an area and dispersed
   matrilines spread over larger geographic areas. The variation in
   matrilinear structure might be due to differences in competitive
   abilities among females and habitat limitations. The influence of
   kin-related spatial structure on inclusive fitness needs to be clarified
   in solitary mammals.},

Abstract = {A survey of the distribution and ecology of riparian beetles in
   Fennoscandia and adjacent countries is presented and the conservation
   value of, and threats to, the element are discussed. Contrary to most
   other taxa or ecological groups, the number of riparian species
   increases from south to north in Scandinavia. The inner parts of the
   counties of Sor-Trondelag (STI) in Central Norway and Troms (TRI) in
   North Norway have the largest total number of riparian species, the
   largest number of vulnerable (red-listed) riparian species, and the
   largest importance index, rarity factor and algorithmic ranking in
   Fennoscandia. These provinces may be regarded as hot spots for riparian
   species in northwestern Europe and therefore have high conservation
   value. In addition to river regulation, river banks are exposed to a
   number of impacts such as removal of sediment and fluvial woodlands,
   wear and tear, construction of flood-prevention walls, canalization and
   various other developments (road building, industrial activity, etc.).
   These impacts seem to be more severe in Norway than in Northern Sweden
   and Finland. Due to human impacts, riparian carabid beetles have become
   extinct in parts of their former range in Scandinavia. The possibility
   of re-invasion of species after restoration is discussed.},

Abstract = {In Scandinavia, farmed arctic foxes frequently escape from farms,
   raising concern about hybridization with the endangered wild population.
   This study was performed to find a genetic marker to distinguish escaped
   farm foxes from wild Scandinavian foxes. Microsatellite and
   mitochondrial control region variation were analyzed in 41 farm foxes.
   The results were compared with mitochondrial and microsatellite data
   from the wild population in Scandinavia. The farm foxes were genetically
   distinct from the wild foxes (F (ST)=0.254, P < 0.00001) and all farm
   foxes had a single control region haplotype different from those
   observed in the wild population. We developed a method based on
   Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) on the mitochondrial
   control region to differentiate between farmed and wild arctic foxes.
   This test was subsequently successfully used on 25 samples from
   free-ranging foxes, of which four had a suspected farm origin. All four
   of the suspected foxes, and none of the others, carried the farm fox
   haplotype. Three of these were successfully genotyped for all eleven
   microsatellite loci. A population assignment test and a Bayesian Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo analysis indicated that two of these individuals were
   escaped farm foxes, and that the third possibly was a hybrid between a
   farmed and a wild arctic fox.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {In many parts of Africa, illegal hunting is considered the most pressing
   issue in protected areas. Poaching has remained a persistent problem
   through the 50 year long history of Serengeti National Park. Around 2
   million people live along the borders of the park. Poverty is
   widespread, and the population is increasing rapidly. In this paper we
   examine the local perceptions of importance and reasons for hunting,
   gender differences and opinions about mitigating measures among
   villagers around Serengeti's Western Corridor. The data were collected
   through interviewing 590 persons in eight villages close to the borders
   of the park. Hunting is driven by the need to not only increase food
   supply and cash income, but also fulfil cultural and social needs. We
   also identified a proactive attitude in the rural communities towards
   reducing illegal hunting and more constructive relationships with the
   management authorities of the national park. The role of hunting in
   community life extends beyond the immediate poverty issue, and should be
   seen as an element in the larger development agenda of rural Tanzania
   and the quest for models for sustainable wildlife management.},

Abstract = {The Tana river, in northern Norway has the largest wild Atlantic salmon
   stock in the world. Each summer more than I million smolts, representing
   nearly 20\% of the total number of Atlantic salmon smolts produced
   annually in Norwegian rivers, descend through the large estuary of this
   river. Several marine fishes feed in the estuary during the summer
   months, and because the descending smolts are suitable prey, predation
   by these species was expected to be significant for the survival of the
   smolts.
   In 2000 (mid-June to early August), nearly 500 cod (Gadus morhua L.),
   saithe (Pollachius virens L.), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), haddock
   (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and sea trout (Salmo trutta) were caught by
   hand jigging and troll fishing in the estuary and inner part of the Tana
   fjord before, during and after the smolt run. Based on analyses of the
   fish stomach contents, lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) was found to
   be the dominant prey, while no remains of Atlantic salmon, including
   otoliths, were found. We conclude that neither marine fishes nor
   anadromous trout are significant predators on salmon smolts in the
   estuary and inner fjord, probably due to a large abundance of lesser
   sandeel. Sandeel may thus be a key factor for the status of the Tana
   river as one of the world best Atlantic salmon rivers, by reducing the
   high smolt and post-smolt mortality as observed in several other
   estuaries and fjords. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We compared mitochondrial DNA and gill-raker number variation in
   populations of the European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) species
   complex to illuminate their evolutionary history, and discuss mechanisms
   behind diversification. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism
   (SSCP) and sequencing 528 bp of combined parts of the cytochrome oxidase
   b (cyt b) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) mithochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) regions, we documented phylogeographic relationships among
   populations and phylogeny of mtDNA haplotypes. Demographic events behind
   geographical distribution of haplotypes were inferred using nested clade
   analysis (NCA) and mismatch distribution. Concordance between
   operational taxonomical groups, based on gill-raker numbers, and mtDNA
   patterns was tested. Three major mtDNA clades were resolved in Europe: a
   North European clade from northwest Russia to Denmark, a Siberian clade
   from the Arctic Sea to southwest Norway, and a South European clade from
   Denmark to the European Alps, reflecting occupation in different glacial
   refugia. Demographic events inferred from NCA were isolation by
   distance, range expansion, and fragmentation. Mismatch analysis
   suggested that clades which colonized Fennoscandia and the Alps expanded
   in population size 24 500-5800 years before present, with minute female
   effective population sizes, implying small founder populations during
   colonization. Gill-raker counts did not commensurate with hierarchical
   mtDNA clades, and poorly with haplotypes, suggesting recent origin of
   gill-raker variation. Whitefish designations based on gill-raker numbers
   were not associated with ancient clades. Lack of congruence in
   morphology and evolutionary lineages implies that the taxonomy of this
   species complex should be reconsidered.},

Title = {The origins of the southern Scandinavian wolf Canis lupus population:
   potential for natural immigration in relation to dispersal distances,
   geography and Baltic ice},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {383-391},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ever since the present phase of wolf Canis lupus population growth began
   in southern Scandinavia in 1983 there has been controversy surrounding
   their origins. Genetical analyses have clarified that the wolves
   originate from the Finnish-Russian populations, but the debate continues
   about how they came to be in southern Scandinavia, with many
   wolf-opponents claiming they have been released in a clandestine action.
   By comparing the geography of Scandinavia to known wolf dispersal
   behaviour our analysis focuses on whether it is possible for wolves to
   have recolonised southern Scandinavia without human assistance. From 298
   published dispersal distances for North American wolves, 10 were over
   500 km, with the longest being 886 kin in a straight line. When also
   including data on actual distance moved, several wolves have been
   recorded to travel more than 4,000 km, often within only a few months.
   However, the published data are biased towards short-distance movements.
   Any wolves travelling from the Finnish-Russian border to the site of the
   1983 reproduction would have to have travelled > 1,000 km, with
   potential routes being overland, or over the ice covered Baltic Sea
   during winter. From their present distribution, wolves have shown a
   clear ability to cross areas of sea-ice of up to 70 km. Therefore, it is
   possible for wolves to have colonised south Scandinavia through natural
   dispersal, although it requires movements at the extreme edge of what
   has been documented. As wolves expand in both southern Scandinavia and
   Finland, the distance between the populations will decrease, although
   contact will require passing through 500 kin of the conflict-full
   reindeer-herding areas or crossing of the Baltic Ice.},

Abstract = {Understanding how climate influences ecosystems represents a challenge
   in ecology and natural resource management. Although we know that
   climate affects plant phenology and herbivore performances at any single
   site, no study has directly coupled the topography-climate interaction
   (i.e. the climatological downscaling process) with large-scale
   vegetation dynamics and animal performances. Here we show how climatic
   variability (measured by the North Atlantic oscillation `NAO') interacts
   with local topography in determining the vegetative greenness (as
   measured by the normalized difference vegetation index `NDVI') and the
   body masses and seasonal movements of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in
   Norway. Warm springs induced an earlier onset of vegetation, resulting
   in earlier migration and higher body masses. Increasing values of the
   winter-NAO corresponded to less snow at low altitude (warmer, more
   precipitation results in more rain), but more snow at high altitude
   (colder, more precipitation corresponds to more snow) relative to
   winters with low winter-NAO. An increasing NAO thus results in a
   spatially more variable phenology, offering migrating deer an extended
   period with access to high-quality forage leading to increased body
   mass. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating spring as
   well as the interaction between winter climate and topography when
   aiming at understanding how plant and animal respond to climate change.},

Abstract = {Climatic conditions experienced by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in
   their early development appear to affect parr size at the end of the

   Atlantic Oscillation indices (NAOIs) correlated positively with water
   temperature (degree-days) and discharge in the River Imsa during winter
   (January-April) 1976-2002, indicating a significant oceanic influence on
   the winter conditions in the river. Specific growth rate of Atlantic
   salmon parr during the first year of life and the proportion of
   one-year-old smolts correlated positively with water temperature, flow,
   and NAOI during February-April during the winter of egg incubation, but
   only NAOI was significant when cross-correlating the two series using a
   time difference of 1 year. Water temperature correlated significantly
   with the proportion of salmon cohorts smolting and migrating to sea at

Abstract = {Fifteen adult nembwe Serranochromis robustus (Giinther, 1864) were
   tagged with radio transmitters in the Zambezi River, Namibia, from 4-15
   November 2000 to record behaviour and outline the implications for
   fisheries management. The fish were tracked on average every 3.7 days
   until 18 May 2001. They stayed within relatively small home ranges, with
   a 95\% probability of localization within an average area of 184 563
   m(2). The fish utilized a mean river stretch of 1330 m (range =
   24-3787). Nembwe were recorded in a variety of habitats, and the
   individual variation in movements and habitat use was substantial. All
   the fish were recorded in the mainstream of the river, but 62\% of the
   fish were recorded in one or more additional main habitat types. During
   rising and high water, 67\% and 71\% of the fish, respectively, were
   recorded in adjacent temporary flooded areas during some or all tracking
   surveys, but did not undertake long-distance migrations onto the
   floodplains. It is concluded that although staying within relatively
   small home ranges, nembwe appears as a species with a variable and
   flexible habitat utilization.},

   the lowest concentration of all species (median sumPBDE: 3 ng/g ww). The
   levels in the peregrine falcon are similar to those found earlier in the
   Baltic region {[}Lindberg, P., Sellstrom, U., Haggberg, L., Wit, C.A.,

   in eggs of peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) breeding in Sweden.
   Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (1), 93-96]. The differences between species
   are not fully explainable, due to lack of data from the major food
   species. BB 101 and 153 were found in eggs of all investigated bird
   species. Especially in samples of white-tailed sea eagle, peregrine
   falcon and goshawk additional unknown penta- and hexabrominated
   biphenyls were detected. TBBP A was detected in all of eight eggs
   analysed sampled from four different bird of prey species. The naturally
   occurring halogenated compounds Q1, the dibromotrichloro monoterpene
   MHC-1, and 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) were detected in all of seven
   analysed samples except for one peregrine falcon egg. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {Radio tagged wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (n = 30) and sea trout
   Salmo trutta (n = 19) were simultaneously released from a sea pen
   outside the mouth of the River L ae rdalselva and their migration to
   spawning areas was recorded. The distance from the river mouth to a
   position held at spawning ranged from 2 to 24 kin and did not differ
   between the species (mean +/- S.D. 15(.)9 +/- 4(.)3 and 14(.)9 +/- 5(.)2
   km for Atlantic salmon and sea trout, respectively). The duration of the
   migration phase, however, was significantly shorter for Atlantic salmon
   than for sea trout (8-12 days, respectively). All Atlantic salmon
   migrated straight to an area near the spawning ground, whereas 50\% of
   the sea trout had a stepwise progression with one or more periods with
   erratic movements before reaching the spawning area. After the migration
   phase, a distinct search phase with repeated movements up- and
   downstream at or close to the position held at spawning was identified
   for the majority of the fishes (75\%, both species). This search phase
   was significantly shorter for Atlantic salmon than for sea trout (mean
   13-31 days, respectively). Mean +/- S.D. length of the river stretch
   used during the search phase was larger for sea trout (3(.)3 +/- 2(.)5
   km) than for Atlantic salmon (1(.)2 +/- 0(.)9 km). A distinct holding
   phase, with no movements until spawning, was also observed in the
   majority of the Atlantic salmon (80\%, mean duration 22 days) and sea
   trout (65\%, mean duration 12 days). For both species, a weak,
   non-significant trend was observed in the relationship between time
   spent on the migration phase, and time spent on the search (r(2) = 0.43)
   and holding phase (r(2) 0.24). There was a highly significant decrease,
   however, in the duration of the holding phase with an increase in the
   time spent on the search phase (r(2) = 0.67). (c) 2005 The Fisheries

Abstract = {Agricultural practise has changed during the last decades. This may be
   reflected in wildlife utilising such habitats. In the present study,
   remote sensing techniques were used to evaluate changes in agricultural
   land cover in a spring staging area for the Svalbard breeding population
   of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) in Vesteralen, Northern
   Norway. Satellite images revealed changes in agricultural practice
   during the period 1985-2001, with a corresponding change in potential
   habitats for geese. Overall, the amount of highly productive fields
   decreased and areas of less intensively managed or abandoned fields
   increased. The amount of natural goose habitat, the seashore vegetation
   was relatively stable during the study period. The abandonment and
   extensive farming in peripheral areas of Vesteralen was in contrast to
   the intensively driven, large farms in central areas. This polarization
   in agricultural practice involved an increase in unattractive fields for
   geese in peripheral areas, eventually reducing the carrying capacity. As
   a result, geese may be concentrated on fewer intensively farmed areas.
   Goose numbers did not completely follow the trend expected from changes
   in habitat availability. Apparently, traditional site use and topography
   also influenced the utilisation of the various sites. Moreover, the
   intensive scaring activities carried out by farmers in Vesteralen over
   the last decade influenced goose usage as they prevent geese from fully
   exploit the areas. Accordingly, the situation for pink-footed geese
   staging in Northern Norway during spring may deteriorate if the observed
   trend in agricultural practice and scaring regimes continue. (c) 2005

Abstract = {Climatic changes are disrupting otherwise tight trophic interactions
   between predator and prey. Most of the earlier studies have primarily
   focused on the temporal dimension of the relationship in the framework
   of the match-mismatch hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that
   predator's recruitment will be high if the peak of the prey availability
   temporally matches the most energy-demanding period of the predators
   breeding phenology. However, the match-mismatch hypothesis ignores the
   level of food abundance while this can compensate small mismatches.
   Using a novel time-series model explicitly quantifying both the timing
   and the abundance component for trophic relationships, we here show that
   timing and abundance of food affect recruitment differently in a marine
   (cod/zooplankton), a marine-terrestrial (puffin/herring) and a
   terrestrial (sheep/vegetation) ecosystem. The quantification of the
   combined effect of abundance and timing of prey on predator dynamics
   enables us to come closer to the mechanisms by which environment
   variability may affect ecological systems.},

Abstract = {Lipid density appears to influence life-history decisions in salmonid
   fishes. This study shows that parr and smolts of anadromous Atlantic
   salmon from a south Norwegian river have on average between 30 and 40\%
   higher energy level than corresponding brown trout in spring and summer,
   which may explain differences in life-history traits between the two
   species. The higher energy density of young salmon was chiefly due to a
   1.8 times higher lipid density in parr and 2.4 times higher lipid
   density in smolts. The difference was smaller among immature parr in the
   autumn, with only 1.4 times higher lipid density in salmon than trout.
   The reason for the decreased difference was probably that the more
   energy rich salmon parr had attained maturity at the time. Among mature
   male parr, the somatic energy density was approximately 10\% higher in
   trout than salmon. However, the gonadal energy content was more than
   twice as high in salmon than in trout. The higher somatic energy
   allocation in parr of Atlantic salmon probably influences protein growth
   of the two species in fresh water, and increases the ability of salmon
   relative to trout to undertake long distance feeding migrations and make
   large investments in reproduction.},

Abstract = {Studies on wild Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) have revealed variation in
   reproduction between areas, years and individuals. In order to explore
   potential causes for this variation other than food supply, we analysed
   data from captive lynx, which provide conditions with minimal
   environmental variation as all were fed ad libitum. Data from 37
   individual female lynx were available from 20 zoos in Norway, Sweden,
   Finland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Data on 177 reproductive
   events (where a male was available to the female at mating time) are
   presented. Of these events, 85\% resulted in litters being born. Average
   litter size was 1.95, with a variation from 1 to 4. The mean birth date
   was 26th May, and sex ratio was not significantly different from parity.
   The probability of reproduction was related to age, with fewer litters
   produced by the very young (2-3-year old), and no sign of a senescence
   effect. However, a clear effect of senescence on litter size was
   evident. The captive lynx did not have higher reproductive rates than
   wild lynx, indicating that either factors other than food supply are
   driving the variation in wild lynx reproduction, or that a factor such
   as stress may be causing additional variation in the captive population.},

Title = {The effect of climate on adult survival in five species of North
   Atlantic seabirds},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {74},
Number = {5},
Pages = {817-831},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. In long-lived species, adult survival is an important life-history
   trait. Better knowledge of the effects of non-catastrophic climate
   variation on the adult survival of long-lived seabirds is therefore
   needed. However, documentation of such effects is still rare.
   2. Using capture-mark-resighting data, we modelled the annual survival
   rates of five species of seabirds, the common guillemot (Uria aalge),
   Brunnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia), razorbill (Alca torda), Atlantic
   puffin (Fratercula arctica) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa
   tridactyla). The data spanned 14 years of observation at a colony on
   Hornoya, off Northern Norway in the western Barents Sea.
   3. A method of taking into account ring-loss of marked individuals is
   proposed. This approach made it possible to keep many observations which
   otherwise would have to be discarded.
   4. The estimated survival rates were higher and less variable than most
   estimates for the same species from other colonies. There was extensive
   resighting heterogeneity. Ignoring this effect would have underestimated
   breeding life span by more than 50\% in some species.
   5. The analysis presented is the first study to document a correlation
   between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and adult survival in
   North Atlantic seabirds. Other environmental variables considered were
   sea surface temperatures (SST) and prey stocks. In most of the species,
   models incorporating climatological variables were considerably better
   supported than models with constant survival, time-dependent survival or
   prey effects. SSTs tended to explain more of the variability in seabird
   survival than did the NAO.
   6. The importance of prey availability was evident in some of the
   species, but climate was generally a better predictor of survival.
   Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that meteorological parameters
   affect seabird mortality only indirectly, possibly through the food
   chain. This conclusion rests on the observations that most NAO effects
   are lagged, and that survival rates decreased with increasing SSTs.},

   (Phalacrocorax aristotelis)},

Abstract = {Diving is believed to be very costly in cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae)
   when compared with other avian divers because of their poor insulation
   and less-efficient foot propulsion. It was therefore suggested that
   cormorants might employ a behavioural strategy to reduce daily energy
   expenditure by minimizing the amount of time spent in water. However,
   European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) have been observed to spend
   up to 7 h day(-1) diving in water of around 5-6 degrees C. To gain a
   better understanding of the energetic requirements in European shags, we
   measured their metabolic rates when resting in air/water and during
   shallow diving using respirometry. To investigate the effects of water
   temperature and feeding status on metabolic rate, birds dived at water
   temperatures ranging from 5 to 13 degrees C in both post-absorptive and
   absorptive states. In parallel with respirometry, stomach temperature
   loggers were deployed to monitor body temperature. Basal metabolic rate
   (BMR) was almost identical to allometric predictions at 4.73 W kg(-1).
   Metabolic rate when resting on water, during diving and after feeding
   was significantly elevated when compared with the resting-in-air rate.
   During diving, the metabolic rate of post-absorptive shags increased to
   22.66 W kg(-1), which corresponds to 4.8 X BMR. Minimum cost of
   transport (COT) was calculated at 17.8 J kg(-1) m(-1) at a swim speed of
   1.3 m s(-1). Feeding before diving elevated diving metabolic rate by 13
   for up to 5 h. There was a significant relationship between diving
   metabolic rate and water temperature, where metabolic rate increased as
   water temperature declined. Thermal conductance when resting in air at
   10-19 degrees C was 2.05 W m(-2) degrees C-1 and quadrupled during
   diving (7.88 W m(-2) degrees C-1). Stomach temperature when resting in
   air during the day was 40.6 degrees C and increased during activity. In
   dive trials lasting up to 50 min, stomach temperature fluctuated around
   a peak value of 42.0 degrees C. Hence, there is no evidence that
   European shags might employ a strategy of regional hypothermia. The
   energetic costs during shallow diving in European shags are considerably
   lower than has previously been reported for great cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax carbo) and are comparable to other foot-propelled divers.
   The lower dive costs in shags might be the consequence of a more
   streamlined body shape reducing hydrodynamic costs as well as a greater
   insulative plumage air layer (estimated to be 2.71 mm), which reduces
   thermoregulatory costs. The latter might be of great importance for
   shags especially during winter when they spend extended periods foraging
   in cold water.},

Abstract = {Electrophoretic studies of proteins remain a primary source of insight
   into genetic diversity in many species including the Atlantic salmon
   Salmo salar, one of the most culturally and economically important fish
   species of the North Atlantic region. Since 1966, > 350 scientific
   papers on protein variation have been published encompassing 25 000+
   salmon from over 400 locations in > 200 river systems across the
   species' distribution. Variation has been detected at 30\% of the 110
   protein loci screened, though most studies examine < 40. The method has
   been applied largely to the investigation of population structure and
   differentiation, but work has also led to the systematic revision of the
   genus Salmo and remains the primary source of insight into hybridization
   in the wild with brown trout Salmo trutta. Spatial patterns of
   differentiation show temporal stability, both within and among river
   systems, and strongly support structuring of the species into river and
   tributary specific populations and the designation of European and North
   American populations as distinct sub-species. They also show widespread
   regional differentiation within both continents, beyond the marked
   subcontinental differences between Baltic Sea and Atlantic Ocean
   populations in Europe. Most of the differentiation probably reflects
   gene flow and founder events associated with colonization following the
   retreat of the glaciers from much of the species' modern range. However,
   variation at MEP-2{*} shows strong correlations with environmental
   temperature, both within and among rivers, and associations with
   phenotypic performance. This suggests selection is acting on the locus
   and provides compelling evidence for the local adaptation of
   populations. Protein studies have led to more population centred
   management of the species and have been exploited in the discrimination
   of regional stocks in mixed stock analysis in high seas fisheries,
   particularly in the Baltic Sea, and as markers for the assessment of
   stocking success. They have also advanced insight into how the genetic
   character of populations can be changed in cultivation and the potential
   impact of salmon aquaculture and stocking on wild populations. The
   method has been largely superseded by DNA based analyses, but the
   results remain highly relevant to Atlantic salmon management and
   conservation and are an irreplaceable data set for studying genetic
   stability of populations over time. (c) 2005 Crown copyright.},

Abstract = {Lobon-Cervia and Rincon analysed the dynamics of a stream-resident brown
   trout (Salmo trutta) population using stock-recruitment relationships,
   and reported no indication of density dependence but strong effects of
   water discharge on juvenile production. The authors concluded to have
   demonstrated an example of a population where ``... endogenous
   density-dependent mechanisms played, at most, a limited role{''} for
   population dynamics (p. 643), and that the population persists with
   ``... little or no operation of endogenous regulatory mechanisms{''} (p.
   641). Further, they ``... question the extent to which generalizations
   claiming that most natural animal populations should be subject to the
   operation of regulatory feedback mechanisms hold for fish
   populations{''} (p. 644). If these conclusions were accurate, it should
   radically alter our view of fish population dynamics and how such
   populations should be managed. However, here I argue that these
   conclusions should be treated cautiously, and suggest alternative
   interpretations which are more consistent with theory and previous
   empirical research. Furthermore, using the study of Lobon-Cervia and
   Rincon as an illustrative example, I suggest that additional insight
   into population dynamics may be attained by shifting the focus away from
   the conventional absolute distinction between density-dependent and
   -independent factors towards studies that address the potential for
   interactions between external forces and density.},

Abstract = {Predatory behavior of wolves (Canis lupus) was studied in 2 wolf
   territories in Scandinavia. We used hourly data from Global Positioning
   System (GPS)-collared adult wolves in combination with Geographic
   Information System (GIS) for detailed analyses of movement patterns. We
   tested the hypothesis that wolves spend 1-2 days close to larger prey
   such as moose (Alces alces) and reasoned that 1-2 locations per day
   would be enough to find all larger prey killed by the wolves. In total,
   the study period comprised 287 days and yielded 6,140 hourly GPS
   positions, with an average of 21.4 2.4 (SID) daily positions. Depending
   on the radius used to define clusters, 4,045-5,023 (65.9-81.8\%)
   positions were included in 622-741 GPS-clusters. We investigated all
   positions within clusters in the field, and 244 (22\%) single positions.
   In total, we found 68 moose and 4 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and
   classified them as wolf-killed within the study period. Another 10-15
   moose may have been killed but not found. The GIS analyses indicated the
   proportion of wolf-killed ungulates included in GPS clusters to be
   strongly dependent on both number of positions per day and the radius
   used for defining a set of spatially aggregated GPS positions as a
   cluster. A higher proportion (78\%) of killed prey in clusters based on
   nighttime (2000-0700) than those based on daytime (0800-1900) positions
   (41\%). Simulation of aerial search during daylight hours for killed
   moose resulted in a serious underestimation (> 60\%) as compared to the
   number of wolf-killed moose found during the study. The average kill
   rate, corrected for 14\% nondetected moose, in the territories was
   3.6-4.0 days per killed moose. We concluded that the feeding behavior of
   wolves in Scandinavia was either different from wolves preying on moose
   and living at the same latitude in North America, or that estimates of
   wolf kill rates on moose may have been seriously underestimated in
   previous North American studies.},

Abstract = {Indirect mate choice is any behavior that restricts the individual's set
   of potential mates without discrimination of mate attributes directly,
   for example, by having preferences about where to mate. We analyzed a
   14-year data set from great snipe (Gallinago media) leks for evidence of
   indirect mate choice based on relative and absolute position of lek
   territories. We found little or no effect of the centrality of
   territories on mating and no between-year consistency in the spatial
   distribution of matings within leks. Instead, the probability of matings
   occurring at a particular site increased if the current territory owner
   had mated the previous year. Furthermore, individual females returned in
   later seasons to mate with the same male as previously rather than at
   the same site. Previous work found that male interactions and dominance
   do not control matings and that females are very choosy about which
   territory they mate in. Here we show that this is because of the male
   occupying the territory rather than its position. We therefore conclude
   that direct female mate choice is the main behavioral process affecting
   variation in mating success among great snipe males, unlike in some
   lekking mammals where male competition and/or indirect mate choice
   appears more important.},

Abstract = {Age structure, tree characteristics, and environmental data were used to
   analyze the status of the birch treeline in three regions along the
   Scandes Mountains from 62 degrees 10'N to 69 degrees 50'N. Aspect and
   estimated relative radiation explained most of the treeline altitude
   across studied regions, but not all variation. Main tree establishment
   occurred during the 1940s in the southern and northernmost regions, and
   during the 1960s in the middle region. Age distribution patterns at 2 m
   (tree size), however, showed stable or possibly progressive treelines in
   the southern and middle regions but recent recession in the north.
   Growth rates varied through time and between regions, with an apparent
   decrease in the north since the 1940s. Weak negative correlations
   between attitude and age in the south indicate recent changes favoring
   tree growth or increased turnover at higher, more exposed altitudes.
   Although Scandinavian treelines are expected to advance in response to
   climate warming, this was not evident as a general pattern for all
   regions. Seasonally different climate patterns, browsing, and abrasion
   are mechanisms involved in this, These regionally different patterns
   have to be taken into account in predictions of future responses to
   avoid overestimation of, e.g., ecosystem change, carbon uptake capacity,
   and feedbacks to climate systems.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal migratory behaviour of wild Atlantic salmon smolt
   (Salmo salar L.) was investigated at the River Utsjoki, a tributary of
   the sub-Arctic River Tana, using submerged video cameras that covered
   the entire water column across the river. The matrix of cameras provided
   information on the exact time. position in water column, and swimming
   direction of individual smolts. The smolt migration started in the
   beginning of June and ended in the middle of July, i,e, during the
   period of midnight sun. In contrast to most other studies, smolts
   migrated all day, with a peak from 07:00 to 10:00 h. Hours of sunshine
   and change in water level explained 55\% of day-to-day variation in
   numbers of migrating smolts. Most smolts migrated actively (head first)
   in lower part of the water column with only 4\% observed in the upper 30
   cm surface water layer, (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V, All rights reserved.},

Title = {Relationships between ecological variables and four organochlorine
   pollutants in an artic glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) population},

Abstract = {The Arctic has become a sink for organochlorine contaminants (OCs) from
   lower latitudes, and relatively high levels have been found in different
   biota. Recent studies of the glaucous gull, Larus hyperboreus, a top
   predator in the arctic food web, have documented that high blood
   residues of various OCs are related to lower reproductive performance
   and reduced adult survival. Here we provide additional evidence that OCs
   are having ecological effects in the glaucous gull population at Bear
   Island in the Norwegian Arctic, and compare the effects of the four
   major OCs found in the glaucous gulls: HCB, oxychlordane, DDE and PCBs,
   which made up > 95\% of measured OCs. Firstly; it has previously been
   shown that gulls with high levels of PCBs in their blood spent more time
   away from-the nest site during incubation than gulls with low levels.
   Here we reanalyzed the data and found that PCBs (P < 0.02) and
   oxychlordane (P < 0.05) were positive and significantly related to time
   away from the nest site, while DDE and HCB were not related to this
   trait. Secondly, among females which bred in an area where fish
   dominated the diet, and thus had high flight costs during feeding, early
   chick growth was negatively related to maternal levels of all four OCs,
   especially HCB and DDE (P < 0.01). On the contrary, among females
   breeding in an area where the diet was dominated by eggs and young from
   nearby seabird colonies, and thus feeding costs were low, there were no
   effects of OC levels on early chick growth. This indicates that
   additional stress may be fundamental in causing reproductive effects of
   OCs in this population. Finally, during three breeding seasons we
   examined the probability of adults returning to the breeding grounds in
   the subsequent season, as a function of blood concentration of the four
   OCs. Overall, return rate from one year to the next was negatively
   related to blood residues of oxychlordane (P=0.02), but not
   significantly related to the other three compounds. Further support for
   the importance of oxychlordane was that a 60\% drop in the blood levels
   between 1997 and 2000 led to a significant increase in return rate
   between these two years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Interseasonal variation in blood concentrations of organochlorines in
   great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1801-1806},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In two subsequent breeding seasons (2001 and 2002), we measured 12
   organochlorines (OCs), including hexachlorobenzene (HCB),
   beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH),
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichioroethylene (DDE), oxychlordane, and eight
   polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs), in the blood of the same 25
   great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus). The wet-weight concentrations
   of different OCs in the blood decreased between 45 and 60\% from 2001 to
   2002. The main reasons for this were lower blood-lipid concentrations
   and higher body condition in 2002 compared to 2001. The differences in
   blood lipids and body condition probably resulted from changes in the
   availability of different prey types between the years. Despite the
   variation in the blood concentrations of OCs, there was a high
   predictability of the relative relationship among individuals between
   the years, especially for the most-persistent compounds (persistent
   PCBs, oxychlordane, and DDE); that is, individuals with high levels in
   2001 still had relatively high levels compared to other individuals in
   2002. This suggests that a concentration obtained from a single blood
   sample is a relatively reliable measurement of OC burdens for individual
   great black-backed gulls compared to other individuals, independent of
   changes in mean OC levels within the population. However, by including
   information about the nutritional status of individuals, more precise
   interference from samples in different years and locations may be made.
   Moreover, the great seasonal variation in OC levels within individuals
   may have implications for how OC monitoring should be conducted in gull
   populations.},

Title = {Predicting the growth of a small introduced muskox population using
   population prediction intervals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {74},
Number = {4},
Pages = {612-618},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. A key issue in ecology is the prediction of future population
   fluctuations. Such population predictions are fundamental for
   population-viability analysis and are essential for assessing the
   implications of various management actions. Development of reliable
   population predictions is however, difficult because it requires
   estimation and modelling of the separate effects of the deterministic
   components of the population dynamics as well as the stochastic
   influences on the population fluctuations. Here we model the stochastic
   dynamics of an introduced population of muskox Ovibos moschatus in the
   Dovrefjell mountains of central Norway, using a simple model without
   density regulation. Our aim is to examine quantitatively factors
   affecting the accuracy of the population projections by applying the
   concept of Population Prediction Interval (PPI).
   2. The long-term growth rate was (s) over cap = 0.0511, assuming no
   density dependence. The environmental variance was relatively large
   ((sigma) over cap (2)(e)= 0.0159). This gives a deterministic growth
   rate of r = 0.0591. However, accounting for losses due to various kinds
   of human activities resulted in a nearly doubling of s (\% = 0.0980).
   3. Autumn temperature and late winter snow depth were each able to
   explain a significant proportion of the annual variation in population
   growth rates.
   4. The impact of environmental stochasticity made the PPI wide after
   only a few years. Uncertainties in the estimates of the population
   parameters were quite small and had a minor impact on the PPI.
   5. A sensitivity analysis showed that ignoring demographic stochasticity
   led to an overestimate of the environmental variance sigma(2)(e), but
   that the impact on the width of the PPI was small.
   6. This study shows that reliable projections of future population
   growth, even based on simple population models without density
   regulation, are dependent on assessment of the accuracy in the
   population predictions that must be based on estimating and modelling
   the stochastic influences on the population dynamics.},

Title = {Ageing and reproductive effort in male moose under variable levels of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {74},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {1. Capital breeding is a resource use tactic common among polygynous
   mammals, such as many ungulates. Even though large, prime-aged males
   stop eating during the rutting season, younger individuals often do not
   and may adopt alternative mating tactics that are less strenuous. The
   pattern of reproductive effort is therefore probably very variable among
   age classes, but has rarely been quantified in male mammals.
   2. Based on data of body weight of 9949 male moose (Alces alces L.) aged
   up to 21 years from seven populations in Norway, we tested hypotheses
   regarding the pattern of reproductive effort (weight loss during rut) in
   this capital breeder, and how this may be affected by factors such as
   age, population sex ratio and density.
   3. Reproductive effort increased with age, even after prime-age was
   reached around the age of 6 years. This provides the first evidence
   consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis in male mammals. For
   the very oldest males (> 12 years) data were limited, but the tendency
   was that effort stabilized or even decreased slightly. Effort did not
   depend on the population sex ratio or density for adult males.
   4. Yearling males also lost some weight during the rutting season, but
   this was not related to population sex ratio. Decreasing trends in
   yearling body weight as seen in many strongly harvested moose
   populations, therefore are due probably to other causes than earlier
   onset of rutting. Further, effort in yearlings decreased with increasing
   density.
   5. Despite the lack of a correlation between effort and population sex
   ratio, a significantly faster ageing after prime-age was observed with
   an increasingly female-biased population sex ratio. This is consistent
   with the hypothesis that strongly skewed sex ratios may affect the
   ageing process.
   6. Most ungulate populations in Europe and North America are heavily
   harvested or otherwise managed extensively, harvest being typically
   male-biased to varying degrees. The resulting skews in sex ratio provide
   manipulations that give unique opportunities to study life-history
   variation, in particular for large mammals that are otherwise difficult
   to manipulate. These opportunities are currently not fully utilized.},

Abstract = {The use of Population Viability Analysis has recently been criticized
   mainly because uncertainties in population predictions are often
   ignored. We analyzed the viability of Scandinavian wolverine Gulo gulo
   populations that allow for the inclusion of uncertainties in parameter
   estimates and stochastic effects on population dynamics. We used the
   insight gained from analyses of stochastic population models to
   quantitatively analyze different management options for the wolverine.
   These management options were based on data from an individual-based
   demographic study in the Sarek National Park, Sweden, and data from
   monitoring schemes in Norway and Sweden. Stochastic components in
   population dynamics of the wolverine were large. Strong density
   regulation occurred around the carrying capacity. According to the World
   Conservation Union (2001), the carrying capacity of populations must
   exceed 46 sexually mature (>= 3-yr old) females to be considered not
   vulnerable. Continuation of the current levels of offtake in Norway will
   lead to extinction of the wolverine over large parts of the country.
   Hence, current rates of mortality of female wolverine make the northern
   population endangered, whereas the southern population is classified as
   vulnerable. Management plans allowing harvest of individuals should be
   based on a proportional threshold harvest strategy. Only 40-60\% of the
   surplus individuals exceeding a certain threshold for harvesting should
   be removed. Our analyses emphasized the importance of including
   estimates of precision in parameter estimates, including stochastic
   factors in recommendations based on Population Viability Analysis, and
   examining the robustness of the conclusions against variation in crucial
   parameters by sensitivity analyses.},

Abstract = {Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) are responsible for significant depredation on
   domestic lambs in Nor-way. Recreational hunting of lynx is widely used
   to limit lynx population growth and to attempt to remove problem
   individuals. We analyzed the relationship between annual changes in lamb
   losses and lynx hunting on 2 scales. On the county scale, lamb losses
   were related to the size of the lynx population that was reduced through
   the harvest of 294 lynx by hunters during our study, 1995-2001. At the
   level of individual grazing areas, we documented a significant local
   effect of lynx harvest (n = 321 lynx); however, the magnitude of this
   benefit was so small (13 lambs per mate lynx, or 2 lambs per female
   lynx) as to be of little practical benefit. The data indicate that lynx
   hunting only reduces depredation when it reduces the size of the
   population.},

Abstract = {An accidental release of non-toxic waste from decommissioned wood pulp
   industry in the River NumedalslaNgen, Southern Norway, occurred in the
   upper part of the accessible stretches for anadromous fish during a
   study of migration behaviour of radio tagged Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar, n=32, body length 51-99 cm). The fish had completed the migration
   phase and initiated the resident phase characterised by little movement
   until spawning. When the wooden fibres and pulp were released, 16 of 32
   (50\%) salmon showed an immediate avoidance response. Six (19\%) salmon
   moved upstream and 10 (31\%) salmon moved downstream. Of the salmon
   moving downstream, eight (25\%) moved all the way to sea (average 14.8
   km). Four re-entered the River NumedalslaNgen, two entered a
   neighbouring river and two were not recorded later. Fish moving
   downstream but without moving to the sea, moved on average 5.3 km during
   the episode, whereas those moving upstream moved on average 6.7 km. All
   fish recorded after the episode (n=30) survived until the spawning
   season. The study demonstrates that fish in nature may show an evident
   avoidance response, even to non-toxic contaminants. For Atlantic salmon,
   the size of the spawning population may be reduced by fish leaving the
   river (13\% left the river and never came back). Moreover, the dispersal
   of salmon to other rivers may increase, and the distribution of the
   spawning population within the contaminated river may shift.},

Abstract = {Theoretical analyses have shown that the spatial scaling of
   environmental autocorrelation, strength of density regulation, and the
   dispersal of individuals determine the scaling of synchrony in
   population fluctuations. By modeling the separate effects of density
   regulation, environmental stochasticity, and demographic stochasticity,
   we estimate the spatial scaling of the component that is due to
   environmental stochasticity in the population dynamics of roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) in Norway.
   The estimated spatial scaling of the environmental noise was similar to
   200 km. An examination of how different weather variables influenced the
   scaling indicated that snow depth was the major weather variable
   affecting the scaling of synchrony in population fluctuations, and was
   negatively related to population growth rates in 97.4\% of the 151
   populations included in the study. A large-scale climatic phenomenon,
   the North Atlantic Oscillation, was positively related to population
   growth rates in 94.7\% of the populations but did not significantly
   affect the pattern of synchrony among populations.
   We used newly developed theoretical results of the contribution of
   environmental noise and dispersal to the spatial scale of synchrony to
   show that the spatial scaling estimated in this study could not be
   explained by dispersal. This suggests that common environmental noise
   operating mainly during the winter is able to synchronize population
   fluctuations of roe deer over large distances.},

Abstract = {Current methods for measuring similarity among phytophagous insect
   communities fail to consider the phylogenetic relationship between host
   plants. We analysed this relation based on 3580 host observations of
   1174 beetle species associated with 100 species of angiosperms in two
   different forest types in Panama. We quantified the significance of
   genetic distance as well as taxonomic rank among angiosperms in relation
   to species overlap in beetle assemblages. A logarithmic model describing
   the decrease in beetle species similarity between host-plant species of
   increasing phylogenetic distance explains 35\% of the variation. Applied
   to taxonomic rank categories the results imply that except for the
   ancient branching of monocots from dicots, only adaptive radiations of
   plants on the family and genus level are important for host utilization
   among phytophagous beetles. These findings enable improvements in
   estimating host specificity and species richness through correction for
   phylogenetic relatedness between hosts and consideration of the
   host-specific fauna associated with monocots.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Pages = {881-893},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Intensification of agriculture since the 1950s has enhanced the
   availability, competitive ability, crude protein content, digestibility
   and extended growing seasons of forage grasses. Spilled cereal grain
   also provides a rich food source in autumn and in winter. Long-distance
   migratory herbivorous geese have rapidly exploited these feeding
   opportunities and most species have shown expansions in range and
   population size in the last 50 years. Results of long-term studies are
   presented from two Arctic-breeding populations, the Svalbard pink-footed
   goose and the Greenland white-fronted goose (GWFG). GWFGs have shown
   major habitat shifts since the 1950s from winter use of plant storage
   organs in natural wetlands to feeding on intensively managed farmland.
   Declines in local density on, and abandonment of, unmodified traditional
   wintering habitat and increased reproductive success among those birds
   wintering on farmland suggest that density-dependent processes were not
   the cause of the shift in this wintersitefaithful population. Based on
   enhanced nutrient and energy intake rates, we argue that observed shifts
   in both species from traditionally used natural habitats to intensively
   managed farmland on spring staging and wintering areas have not
   necessarily been the result of habitat destruction. Increased food
   intake rates and potential demographic benefits resulting from shifts to
   highly profitable foraging opportunities on increasingly intensively
   managed farmland, more likely explain increases in goose numbers in
   these populations. The geographically exploratory behaviour of
   subdominant individuals enables the discovery and exploitation of new
   winter feeding opportunities and hence range expansion. Recent
   destruction of traditional habitats and declines in farming at northern
   latitudes present fresh challenges to the well being of both
   populations. More urgently, Canada geese colonizing breeding and
   moulting habitats of white-fronted geese in Greenland are further
   affecting their reproductive output.},

Title = {Dispersal patterns in a harvested willow ptarmigan population},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {453-459},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Harvest management requires knowledge of whether the harvest is
   sustainable as a result of compensatory mechanisms, such as dispersal.
   The effect of recreational harvesting on dispersal patterns in willow
   ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus was assessed over four hunting seasons in
   central Norway.
   2. A two-parameter Weibull model was fitted to the observed absolute
   dispersal distance data using maximum likelihood methods. Estimates of
   the scale and shape parameters for the dispersal probability
   distribution were calculated, describing the distribution of observed
   willow ptarmigan dispersal distances. From the parameter estimates of
   the dispersal model we estimated the standard deviation of the dispersal
   displacement relevant for population genetic and spatial population
   dynamic models.
   3. The effect of harvesting on dispersal patterns was examined by
   testing for differences in the scale and shape parameters of dispersal
   distance distributions in areas with and without harvest. No effect of
   harvesting was found, either in adults or juveniles.
   4. Breeding dispersal of adult birds was estimated as a dispersal
   probability distribution with scale parameter a = 402 m and shape
   parameter b = 2.01, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation of
   sigma = 284 m. The dispersal probability distribution of adults was not
   significantly different from a bivariate normal distribution.
   5. Natal dispersal had a dispersal probability distribution with scale
   parameter a = 4206 m and shape parameter b = 1.16, corresponding to a
   dispersal standard deviation sigma = 3728 m. The dispersal probability
   distribution of juveniles was not significantly different from an
   exponential distribution.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Reduction of the population density of
   willow ptarmigan through harvesting at moderate densities does not seem
   to affect the dispersal distances. Thus, if there is little or no
   difference in the dispersal probability distribution in harvested and
   non-harvested areas there will be only weak or no compensation for the
   harvest, given that natural mortality and reproduction is the same in
   both areas. Thus, erroneously assuming compensation of harvest by
   immigration into a local population can lead to overharvest.},

Abstract = {In light of the finding of a previously unknown coronavirus as the
   aetiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is
   probable that other coronaviruses, than those recognized to date, are
   circulating in animal populations. Here, the results of a screening for
   coronavirus are presented, using a universal coronavirus RT-PCR, of the
   bird species graylag goose (Anser anser), feral pigeon (Columbia livia)
   and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Coronaviruses were found in cloacal
   swab samples from all the three bird species. In the graylag goose, 40
   of 163 sampled birds were coronavirus positive, whereas two of 100
   sampled pigeons and one of five sampled mallards tested positive. The
   infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared with
   virus-negative birds, suggesting clinical significance of the infection.
   Phylogenetic analyses performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid
   protein sequences, indicated that the novel coronaviruses described in
   the present study all branch off from group III coronaviruses. All the
   novel avian coronaviruses harboured the conserved s2m RNA structure in
   their 3' untranslated region, like other previously described group III
   coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete
   nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon
   coronaviruses, evidenced the presence of two additional open reading
   frames for the goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known
   proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the
   encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for the pigeon
   coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the
   nucleocapsid gene.},

Abstract = {During 1986-2001, denning behaviour of brown bears Ursus arctos was
   documented for 55 dennings of 33 radio-marked males in central Sweden,
   and 12 and 29 dennings of nine males and 19 females, respectively, in
   northern Sweden. Male brown bears spent on average 161 days (27 October
   - 4 April) in dens in the southern area. The duration of their denning
   decreased with increasing age and body mass. Comparing these data with
   those obtained for females in the same study area by Friebe et al.
   (2001), males emerged from dens earlier than females, spending
   significantly less time in their dens. The denning period of females was
   influenced by their reproductive status; pregnant females spent the
   longest time in their dens. Denning dates correlated clearly with timing
   of autumn snowfall. Males in the north denned earlier, emerged later and
   spent on average 45 days more in their dens than males in central
   Sweden. Similarly, females in the north spent on average 37 days more in
   their dens than females in the south. Daily movements of males tracked
   to their dens in 2001 showed a general trend towards lower rates of
   movement in the last two weeks before denning, as found in females. Mean
   distance between dens used in successive years varied with age and sex;
   it was significantly greater for subadult males than for females and
   adult males as a result of dispersal behaviour. Adult bears showed a
   high degree of fidelity to a general denning area within their annual
   ranges.},

Title = {Change-in-sex ratio as an estimator of population size for Norwegian
   moose Alces alces},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-172},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Effective management of ungulates requires regular estimates of
   population abundance, but these are often expensive and hard to obtain.
   We therefore examined if change-in-ratio (CIR) estimation methods, in
   combination with age- and sex-specific data on moose Alces alces
   observed and killed, could be a cheap alternative for estimating moose
   abundance in Norway. We used the large number of moose observations
   reported by moose hunters and estimated pre-harvest adult population
   size based on annual changes in adult sex ratio. Similarly, we estimated
   1) annual recruitment rate based on the proportion of calves observed
   during the hunting season, 2) the harvest rate, and 3) the natural
   mortality rate based on variation in recruitment rate and harvest rate.
   During 1991-2000, annual variation in abundance was correlated with two
   of three independent indices of moose density, indicating that the CIR
   methods provide relatively precise estimates of abundance. Similarly,
   the estimated average natural mortality rate was similar to natural
   mortality rates of radio-collared moose in Scandinavia, and the
   estimated abundance was close to what we expected based on the annual
   harvest. However, large annual variation in estimated rates of natural
   mortality indicated that over- and underestimation of population
   abundance occurred for some years. This was likely due to the fact that
   harvesting occurred during periods of moose observations. Because we had
   no independent estimates of abundance, we were unable to estimate the
   bias. Hence, we concluded that variation in CIR abundance is a sensitive
   index of moose density, but that more studies are needed to determine
   the accuracy of CIR estimates as measurements of abundance. Future
   studies should focus on smaller populations with independent estimates
   on abundance, and base CIR estimation on changes in sex ratio within the
   hunting season to reduce the number of possible confounding effects.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {272},

Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that increased current reproductive effort
   should lead to a fitness cost. This cost of reproduction may be observed
   as reduced survival or future reproduction, and may be caused by
   temporal suppression of immune function in stressed or hard-working
   individuals. In birds, consideration of the costs of incubating eggs has
   largely been neglected in favour of the costs of brood rearing. We
   manipulated incubation demand in two breeding seasons (2000 and 2001) in
   female common eiders (Somateria mollissima) by creating clutches of
   three and six eggs (natural range 3-6 eggs). The common eider is a
   long-lived sea-duck where females do not eat during the incubation
   period. Mass loss increased and immune function (lymphocyte levels and
   specific antibody response to the non-pathogenic antigens diphtheria and
   tetanus toxoid) was reduced in females incubating large clutches. The
   increased incubation effort among females assigned to large incubation
   demand did not lead to adverse effects on current reproduction or return
   rate in the next breeding season. However, large incubation demand
   resulted in long-term fitness costs through reduced fecundity the year
   after manipulation. Our data show that in eiders, a long-lived species,
   the cost of high incubation demand is paid in the currency of reduced
   future fecundity, possibly mediated by reduced immune function.},

Abstract = {Norway is home to the largest populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
   L., and the largest salmon-farming industry in the world. Salmon lice
   Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer) emerged as a problem soon after
   establishment of the industry in the 1970s. This parasitic copepod has
   been blamed for the collapse of sea trout (Salmo trutta L.) stocks in
   several countries, and is also perceived as a serious threat to Atlantic
   salmon smolts migrating through Norwegian fjords and coastal areas in
   spring. The National Action Plan Against Salmon Lice on Salmonids (NA)
   was implemented in 1997 in Norway. Drawn up by the Animal Health
   Authority (AHA), fish health personnel and fish farmers, this was a
   consensus tool to reduce the impact of lice from fanned fish. Important
   measures in the NA were legal limits for the maximum mean number of lice
   per farmed fish, compulsory reporting of lice numbers to the AHA,
   strategic regional treatments against lice, and monitoring of salmon
   lice infection in wild salmonids. This review examines the
   implementation of the NA and attempts to evaluate the success of the
   actions taken in terms of the lice loads found on wild salmonids in
   1998-2002. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The differential allocation of energy to either reproduction or survival
   represents a major conflict with important implications for patterns of
   life history. Here, we explore how covariation between maternal body
   weight and fetal weight vary according to fetal sex in a wild reindeer
   (Rangifer tarandus) population during two contrasting years. Maternal
   weights differed during the 2 years, probably because of a difference in
   population density. We could not detect any change in the allocation to
   reproduction depending on female phenotypic distribution. Male fetuses
   were heavier than female fetuses, with the same relative dimorphism in
   both years. There was no support for a correlation between the sex of
   the fetus carried by a female and her weight. Our results suggest that
   the level of resource allocation to reproduction during the prenatal
   period is strongly determined by female body weight and the allometric
   relationship between body weight and metabolic rate. We discuss the
   consequences of our results for population dynamics. We call for an
   integration of inter- and intraspecific allometric approaches to better
   understand constraints and variation in life-history traits.},

Abstract = {The farming of salmon and other inarimarine finfish in open net pens
   continues to increase along the world's coastlines as the aquaculture
   industry expands to meet human demand. Farm fish are known to escape
   from pens in all salmon aquaculture areas. Their escape into the wild
   can result in in terbreeding a it 4 competition with wild salmon and can
   facilitate the spread of pathogens, thereby placing more pressure on
   already dwindling wild populations. Here we assess the ecological,
   genetic, and socioeconomic impacts of farm salmon escapes, using a
   risk-assessment framework. We show that risks of damage to wild salmon
   populations, ecosystems, and society are large when salmon are farmed in
   their native range, when large numbers of salmon are farmed relative to
   the size of wild populations, and when exotic pathogens are introduced.
   We then evaluate the policy and management options for reducing risks
   and discuss the implications for farming other types of marine finfish.},

Abstract = {We examined genetic differences in the reproduction of an alternative
   maturation phenotype in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by comparing the
   spawning behaviour and success among farmed, first-generation hybrid,
   and wild mature male parr raised in similar environments. Parr competed
   for spawning opportunities in the presence of either wild or farmed
   large males. There were no consistent differences among groups in
   aggression; however, there were differences in spawning participation
   with respect to large male origin and among parr types. There was a
   strong negative temporal effect on mature male parr spawning
   participation that differed by parr type; wild and farmed parr were most
   likely to participate in early spawnings, with hybrids being the most
   likely to participate in late spawnings. Overall, parr were also less
   likely to participate in spawnings involving large farmed males.
   Variance in reproductive success was higher among parr than among large
   males. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that there are
   genetically based behavioural differences among mature male parr of
   farmed and wild origin that may potentially lead to differences in
   reproductive success.},

Abstract = {The feeding ecology of barnacle geese and pink-footed geese was studied
   in Sassendalen, Svalbard during the pre-nesting period (late May) to
   assess the potential for inter-specific competition. Barnacle geese fed
   almost exclusively (97\%) by grazing above-ground plant material, mostly
   (79\%) along snow edges in moss-mat habitats. Pink-footed geese fed
   mostly (93\%) by excavating below-ground parts of plants, mostly (56\%)
   away from snow and were more evenly distributed between habitat types.
   Barnacle goose faeces contained mostly (62\%,) moss, that of pink-footed
   geese mostly (48\%) below-ground plant storage organs (especially
   Bistorta viviparum L.). Principal components analysis of dropping
   contents showed no overlap in species diet in allopatry or sympatry.
   There was little overlap in diet and feeding ecology of the two species
   at this pre-nesting feeding site. Hence, unless increased goose feeding
   densities affect future vegetation density and composition, under
   present circumstances, increasing numbers of either species is unlikely
   to affect foraging conditions for the other at this important stage in
   the annual cycle. However, Such changes could have local
   density-dependent intra-specific effects.},

Abstract = {Combining morphological and genetic analysis, we compared patterns of
   diversification within and between morphs among sympatric European
   whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) populations in Lake Femund, Norway.
   Seven external populations, from potential colonization routes into Lake
   Femund were included. We found that deep-, shallow-, river- and bay
   spawning populations are distinct morphs in Lake Femund. Within morphs,
   populations range from being similar genetically (Fst = 0-0.005) among
   deep-spawning populations to being highly differentiated (Fst = 0.153)
   between bay-spawning populations. Between morphs, genetic differences
   ranged from a low (Fst = 0.008-0.022) between deep- and shallow-spawning
   populations to high difference (Fst = 0.125-0.143) between shallow- and
   bay-spawning populations. A higher proportion of molecular variance was
   seen among (3.9\%) than within morphs (2.8\%). The adaptive gene
   combinations behind the four morphs seem to have originated within the
   lake, although the lake could have been colonized from more than one
   source population.},

Title = {Physiological parameters that affect the transfer of radiocaesium to

Abstract = {Recently there has been a renewed interest in biological scaling
   relationships between parameters, such as those between, for example,
   body mass, dry matter intake and biological half-times of radionuclides
   that are useful in predicting the transfer of radiocaesium to different
   animal species, particularly to wild animals. However, there is still a
   considerable unexplained variability in transfer coefficient estimates
   between individuals of the same species. This paper discusses the
   physiological parameters that affect the transfer of radiocaesium to
   ruminants, and it shows how a better understanding of these parameters
   may help to reduce the within-species variability in radiocaesium
   transfer coefficients. In light of the improved understanding during the
   past 10-15 years of the importance of source-dependent bioavailability
   on absorption of radiocaesium from the gastrointestinal tract, it is
   concluded that further studies are required on the effects of feed
   digestibility and physiological factors on absorption and endogenous
   faecal excretion of radiocaesium to better understand the variability in
   transfer coefficients.},

Abstract = {The great black-backed gull Larus marinus is a top predator in subarctic
   and temperate marine ecosystems, and the aim of this study was to
   investigate if organochlorines (OCs) were related to reproductive
   performance in this species at the subarctic parts of the Norwegian
   Coast. We measured blood levels of various OCs in 53 breeding birds. The
   OC levels were relatively low compared to levels found in nearby arctic
   areas. In females, however, there was a significant positive
   relationship between blood concentrations of OCs, especially
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   (DDE), and egg laying date, and a positive relationship between the
   probability of nest predation and blood concentration of
   beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) oxychlordane, and DDE. In females
   with high levels of OCs, especially persistent polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs), there was also a decline in egg volume as egg laying progressed;
   i.e. the second and third laid egg were relatively smaller, compared to
   females with low OC levels. No relationships between reproductive
   parameters and OC levels were found in males. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus (L.), constitutes a serious
   threat to natural brown trout, Salmo trutta L., stocks in Norway
   following its introduction and translocation. In the present study, the
   leaping capabilities of the European minnow (50-110 mm total length) and
   brown trout (64-255 mm total length) were investigated with the aim of
   constructing suitable waterfall barriers to prevent further unwanted
   dispersal of the minnow, but still allow passage of larger brown trout.
   No successful leap of minnows was recorded at 4.9-6.5 degreesC, even at
   height intervals as low as 3 cm. At 14.0-16.5 degreesC, minnows were
   able to force waterfall barriers up to 27 cm high. At 4.9-6.5 degreesC
   brown trout forced waterfall barriers up to 40 cm. Thus, building of
   such barriers in brooks and rivers can help prevent the dispersal of
   minnows, and still allow larger brown trout to pass during feeding and

Title = {Moose harvesting strategies in the presence of wolves},

Abstract = {1. Large carnivores are currently recolonizing areas where they have
   been extinct for decades. This poses considerable challenges for
   wildlife managers, partly because the optimal harvesting strategies of
   prey populations may be affected. If the carnivores in such areas are
   under strict management control (as in Scandinavia), the predator will
   not show a numerical response to changes in prey density. Consequently,
   the density of prey is mainly determined by the vital rates of the prey
   population and the predation pressure. In this study we modelled the
   optimal harvesting strategy for a prey population in which there was no
   numerical response by the predator.
   2. Our model is an age-structured deterministic matrix model system.
   Optimal harvesting strategies are determined, measuring yield either as
   number of animals harvested or as mass of meat.
   3. First, using a moose population in Hedmark in south-eastern Norway as
   a case study, we demonstrate that continuing to harvest at the rates
   used prior to wolf recolonization will lead to a decline in the moose
   population.
   4. Secondly, harvesting quotas are specified by age and sex, usually
   with a high proportion of calves. Although wolves mainly kill juvenile
   moose (calves and yearlings), the relationship between harvest
   composition and yield is not affected by predation. Both in the presence
   and absence of predation, a high proportion of calves in the harvest
   gives the highest yield measured as the number of animals harvested,
   whereas a high proportion of adults maximizes the yield measured in
   terms of meat. Furthermore, a female-biased sex structure in the
   population gives a higher yield in both the presence and absence of the
   predator.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that managers facing the
   new challenges presented by recolonizing populations of large predators
   such as wolves should reduce the size of harvest quotas in order to
   avoid decreases in prey populations. However, the general relationship
   between the harvesting strategy and yield maximization is not affected
   by wolf predation. The harvest yield from cervid populations is often
   important to local economies, and moose is the single most important
   game species in Scandinavia. It is therefore important to implement
   optimal harvesting strategies under these new conditions in order to
   prevent an unnecessary loss of yield, and success in this task may in
   turn affect local attitudes towards large carnivores.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {By comparing large Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus, which had shown a
   persistent cannibalistic response varying from zero to very high in
   succeeding laboratory trials, with their individual cannibalistic
   behaviour after release into a natural lake inhabited by small Arctic
   charr, it was found that all Arctic charr had the potential to become
   cannibalistic, irrespective of their laboratory behaviour. More
   specifically, Arctic charr that never fed on prey fishes when offered
   them in the tank experiments turned to cannibalism when released in the
   lake, highlighting the potential difficulties in extrapolating
   laboratory results to natural settings. This was also true for naive
   fish that had no prior experience of eating live food. Since no
   significant increase in the number of prey consumed during each of the
   succeeding laboratory trials was found, and naive fish showed a response
   under natural conditions similar to that of their counterparts, the
   training of the Arctic charr (or experience or learning) probably had no
   effect upon the piscivorous or cannibalistic response after stocking.
   Thus, the study appeared to demonstrate that most variations in
   cannibalism in Arctic charr was simply a function of environmental
   conditions, depending on the density of conspecifics v. alternative
   prey, and the relative size difference between predator and prey, rather
   than any genetic influence. (c) 2005 The Fisheries Society of the

Abstract = {Question: What are the relative influences of human impact,
   macroclimate, geographic location and habitat related environmental
   differences on species composition of boreal epiphytic macrolichen
   communities?
   Location: Troms county in northern Norway.
   Methods: Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed the main gradient
   structure in lists of epiphytic macrolichen species from deciduous
   forests. By Canonical Correspondence Analysis with variance
   partitioning, the relative amount of variance in macrolichen species
   composition attributable to human impact, macroclimate, spatial context
   and environmental differences was quantified.
   Results: There was no significant effect of human impact Oil species
   composition of epiphytic macrolichens of deciduous forests. Macroclimate
   was the most important factor determining epiphytic macrolichen
   communities, which were also strongly influenced by ecological
   differences Such as forest stand properties.
   Conclusions: Epiphytic macrolichen communities are determined by a
   macroclimatic gradient from the coastline to the interior of central
   north Norway. In marked contrast, the species composition of epiphytic
   macrolichen communities seems to be unaffected by human impact in the
   study area, where air pollution was marginal.},

Abstract = {In birds, the characteristics of the nest site may affect reproductive
   success. We found that shelter is an important characteristic of the
   Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) nests because shelter prevents
   chick predation. However, the benefit of shelter was counter-vailed by
   melt water which mainly entered well-sheltered nests. Chick survival was
   monitored until the chick was left unattended for the first time.
   Late-hatched chicks had a higher survival probability than early-hatched
   chicks, possibly because late hatchers swamp the predator, the south
   polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki). Poorly sheltered nests tended to be
   occupied by parents with low body mass and late-hatched eggs. The
   results suggest that both shelter per se and parental characteristics
   may explain the relationship between predation risk and shelter. We need
   experiments to study the influence of nest site on reproductive success,
   and we need to map the frequency of melt water as a cause of
   reproductive failure.},

Abstract = {Parasites and diseases constitute major evolutionary forces in many
   natural populations, and thus having an efficient immune defense to
   resist infections is crucial for many organisms. Properties of the
   immune response may also influence mate choice decisions in many
   animals. Theory predicts several advantages for females when choosing
   males with superior immune systems. These benefits can be both direct
   (e.g. increased paternal care and reduced disease transmission) and
   indirect (good genes). We have investigated female choice with respect
   to antibody response to two novel antigens in males of a lekking bird,
   the great snipe (Gallinago media). Because of the lek mating system,
   female choice probably mainly incurs indirect (genetic) rather than
   direct benefits. Males responded to vaccination with diphtheria and
   tetanus toxoids by producing specific antibodies to both antigens.
   Triggering the immune system had no negative impact on display
   activities or survival. Males that were chosen by females as mates had
   on average higher antibody response to the tetanus antigen than their
   neighbors. We did not, however, find any covariance between the strength
   of the antibody response and male mating success.},

Abstract = {The difficulty of obtaining pedigrees for wild populations has hampered
   the possibility of demonstrating inbreeding depression in nature. In a
   small, naturally restored, wild population of grey wolves in
   Scandinavia, founded in 1983, we constructed a pedigree for 24 of the 28
   breeding pairs established in the period 1983-2002. Ancestry for the
   breeding animals was determined through a combination of field data
   (snow tracking and radio telemetry) and DNA microsatellite analysis. The
   population was founded by only three individuals. The inbreeding
   coefficient F varied between 0.00 and 0.41 for wolves born during the
   study period. The number of surviving pups per litter during their first
   winter after birth was strongly correlated with inbreeding coefficients
   of pups (R-2 = 0. 39, p < 0.00 1). This inbreeding depression was
   recalculated to match standard estimates of lethal equivalents (213),
   corresponding to 6.04 (2.58-9.48, 95\% CI) litter-size-reducing
   equivalents in this wolf population.},

Abstract = {A molecular phylogeny of the Spizaetus cirrhatus complex is presented in
   this study, based on two sections of the mitochondrial genome: partial
   sequences of the cytochrome b gene and of the control region (CR). The
   topologies derived from the two sequences are in agreement. Within S.
   cirrhatus distances are rather low (0-1.5\% in cytochrome b). Among the
   cirrhatus subspecies the island taxa floris, vanheurni and andamanensis
   form distinct haplogroups in the CR trees, conforming to the earlier
   subspecific divisions which were based on morphological characters. On
   the other hand, the most widespread Subspecies, limnacetus, does not
   represent a monophyletic group in the gene trees and its haplogroups do
   not Cluster according to geographic affinities. An unambiguous
   resolution of relationships among haplotypes and haplogroups,
   respectively, was not achieved, suggesting a more recent radiation of
   this group of hawk-eagles in the course of the last ice ages. Concerning
   the outgroup taxa Spizaetus philippensis and Spizaetus lanceolatus, our
   data indicate a clear genetic distinction between the two subspecies S.
   P. philippensis and S. p. pinskeri, suggesting that they should be
   treated as distinct species. Yet the phylogenetic relationships of the
   three outgroup taxa with respect to S. cirrhatus are ambiguous in our
   trees. The taxonomic consequences of applying different species concepts
   (BSC, PSC) are discussed. The species concept chosen would result in
   different conservation strategies.},

Abstract = {During 6 November to 24 December 2000, 23 tigerfish {[}(Hydrocynus

   River (Namibia) to record habitat utilisation during low, rising and
   high water levels. The fish were tracked, on average, every fourth day
   during 23 November to 18 May. Two movement patterns were detected.
   Approximately 50\% of the fish moved <1000 m among tracking surveys,
   staying within `defined' home ranges. The remaining fish showed
   consistent site fidelity for periods, with long distance movements
   (>1000 m) to new areas among residency periods. Overall, mean distance
   moved between tracking surveys was 1447 m. Home range size varied among
   individuals, with a 95\% probability of localisation within an average
   area of 276,978 m(2). The fish utilised a mean river stretch of 18,836 m
   (range = 90-71,840). All the fish were recorded in the main stem, and on
   average, 95\% of the fixes were in the main stem during low water.
   However, the fish used temporary flooded areas to an increasing extent
   during the rising and high water period, but did not undertake
   long-distance migrations into the floodplains. Fish were sometimes near
   vegetation, but were never recorded into or under vegetation.},

Abstract = {The community structure of trophically transmitted intestinal helminths
   of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar post-smolts was highly variable among
   four fjords in Norway. There were no severely pathogenic parasite
   species. Post-smolts from the southernmost Trondheimsfjord had a higher
   diversity of freshwater parasite species compared to the three northern
   fjords (Tanatjord, Altatjord and Malangen). In contrast, the highest
   diversity and proportion of marine species was found in the three
   northern fjords. Post-smolts were generally more infected with marine
   parasites in the outer rather than inner parts of all of the fjords. The
   prevalence of the acanthocephalan Echinorynchus gadi (range: 13-42\%)
   and marine trematodes (range: 14-47\%) was higher in post-smolts in
   outer zones of the northern Fjords than in fish from Trondheimsfjord (0
   and 6\%, respectively). The within-fjord variability and north-south
   geographical gradient in parasite infection patterns reflected
   differences in marine feeding of the post-smolts on potential
   intermediate hosts such as amphipods (E. gadi) and fish larvae
   (trematodes), which were higher in the northern fjords (range: 27 28 and
   67-85\%, respectively) than in Trondheimsfjord (5 and 19\%,
   respectively). High intensities of marine parasites suggest that some
   post-smolts from northern fjords may have a prolonged fjord-feeding
   compared to those from Trondheimsfjord. Parasites of both freshwater and
   marine origin appear to be suitable as bio-indicators of feeding and
   migratory pattern of Atlantic salmon post-smolts and preadults during
   their seaward migration. (c) 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British

Title = {Local-scale density-dependent survival of mobile organisms in continuous
   habitats: an experimental test using Atlantic salmon},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {143},
Number = {2},
Pages = {203-210},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For organisms with restricted mobility, density dependence may occur on
   spatial scales much smaller than that of the whole population. Averaging
   densities over whole populations in such organisms gives a more or less
   inaccurate description of the real variation in competitive intensity
   over time and space. The potential for local density dependence in more
   mobile organisms is less well understood, particularly for organisms
   living in continuous habitats. To test for local density-dependent
   processes in such an organism, we manipulated egg density (the number of
   eggs nest(-1)) among ten artificial nests of Atlantic salmon along an
   1,848-m long river during two consecutive years. Eggs in different nests
   were given unique thermal otolith-banding patterns to allow
   identification of juvenile nest origin. At capture, 1-2 months after
   emergence, the spatial distribution of juveniles reflected nest
   locations, with the median absolute dispersal distance being 92 and 41 m
   in the 2 years. Estimated nest-specific survival rates were strongly
   negatively related to hatched-egg density in both years (r(2)=0.72 and
   0.62), despite dramatic differences in overall mean survival (0.22 and
   0.02). Thus, density-dependent survival following emergence in Atlantic
   salmon juveniles occurs on spatial scales much smaller than that of
   whole populations. The consistency across years suggests that the
   phenomenon is likely to occur over most environmental conditions. Our
   observation of local-scale density dependence is consistent with strong
   juvenile territoriality, which forces individuals emerging in
   high-initial density areas to disperse farther, and a high cost
   (metabolic or predation) of dispersal. We conclude that for mobile
   organisms with patchy distributions of propagules and constrained
   juvenile dispersal, increased emphasis on local-scale dynamics should
   enable a more mechanistic understanding of population regulation even in
   continuous habitats, and hence increase the predictive power of
   population models.},

Title = {Estimating population size of elusive animals with DNA from
   hunter-collected feces: Four methods for brown bears},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {150-161},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Noninvasive genetic methods can be used to estimate animal abundances
   and offer several advantages over conventional methods. Few attempts
   have been made, however, to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the
   estimates. We compared four methods of estimating population size based
   on fecal sampling. Two methods used rarefaction indices and two were
   based on capture-mark-recapture (CMR) estimators, one combining genetic
   and field data. Volunteer hunters and others collected 1904 fecal
   samples over 2 consecutive years in a large area containing a
   well-studied population of brown bears (Ursus arctos). On our
   49,000-km(2) study area in south-central Sweden, population size
   estimates ranged from 378 to 572 bears in 2001 and 273 to 433 bears in
   2002, depending on the method of estimation used. The estimates from the
   best model in the program MARK appeared to be the most accurate, based
   on the minimum population size estimate from radio-marked bears in a
   subsection of our sampling area. In addition, MARK models included
   heterogeneity and temporal variation in detection probabilities, which
   appeared to be present in our samples. All methods, though, incorrectly
   suggested a biased sex ratio, probably because of sex differences in
   detection probabilities and low overall detection probabilities. The
   population size of elusive animals can be estimated reliably over large
   areas with noninvasive genetic methods, but we stress the importance of
   an adequate and well-distributed sampling effort. In cases of biased
   sampling, calibration with independent estimates may be necessary. We
   recommend that this noninvasive genetic approach, using the MARK models,
   be used in the future in areas where sufficient numbers of volunteers
   can be mobilized.},

Title = {Thermal adaptation of Arctic charr: experimental studies of growth in
   eleven charr populations from Sweden, Norway and Britain},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {353-368},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Experimental growth data for Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.),
   all fed on excess rations, from 11 European watercourses between 54 and
   70degreesN were analysed and fitted to a new general growth model for
   fish. The model was validated by comparing its predictions with the
   growth rate of charr in the wild.
   2. Growth performance varied among populations, mainly because of
   variation in the maximum growth potential, whereas the thermal response
   curves were similar. The estimated lower and upper temperatures for
   growth varied between -1.7 to 5.3 and 20.8-23.2degreesC, respectively,
   while maximum growth occurred between 14.4 and 17.2degreesC.
   3. There was no geographical or climatic trend in growth performance
   among populations and therefore no indication of thermal adaptation. The
   growth potential of charr from different populations correlated
   positively with fish body length at maturity and maximum weight in the
   wild. Charr from populations including large piscivorous fish had higher
   growth rates under standardised conditions than those from populations
   feeding on zoobenthos or zooplankton. Therefore, the adaptive variation
   in growth potential was related to life-history characteristics and
   diet, rather than to thermal conditions.},

Title = {Managing heterogeneity: the importance of grazing and environmental
   variation on post-fire succession in heathlands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {139-149},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Semi-natural habitats have been shaped by human disturbance regimes
   for centuries. Spatially and temporally heterogeneous land-use
   practices, such as cutting, burning, grazing and turf-cutting, have
   resulted in complex mosaic landscapes that are of high priority for
   conservation in Europe. Contemporary conservation subjects these systems
   to management regimes that are generally less diverse, in terms of
   disturbances and fine-scale temporal and spatial variability, than
   traditional land use, but the ecological consequences of these
   simplifications are unclear.
   2. We investigated the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant
   species composition and diversity along local environmental (moisture)
   gradients in coastal heathlands. A replicated series of post-fire
   successions (n = 12) was initiated in three heathland habitats and the
   areas subjected to two grazing regimes. Floristic and environmental data
   were recorded in permanent plots over a 5-year period. Community data
   were analysed using multivariate ordination techniques (principal
   components analysis, partial redundancy analyses, and principal response
   curves) and generalized linear models.
   3. Fire induced strong successional trends in the species composition of
   the heathlands. These trends differed among heathland habitats, and with
   grazing. Strong interactions between fire, habitat and grazing implied
   that the effect of grazing on the successional dynamics differed among
   habitats. Species diversity decreased in the first year after fire but
   increased beyond the pre-fire levels during succession. This trend was
   not affected by local environment or grazing, although there were main
   effect differences in diversity between environments and grazing
   regimes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the two
   management practices do not have simple additive effects within the
   semi-natural system studied, as grazing created ecological opportunities
   for additional sets of species, increased variability among habitats,
   and added complexity to the post-fire successional dynamics. In order to
   preserve diversity, conservation management should thus aim to preserve
   the level of complexity of the traditional management regimes, both in
   terms of the actual disturbances (e.g. fire and grazing) as well as the
   spatial scales at which they are applied. Further, the considerable
   change in these effects along the local environmental gradient brings
   into question the efficiency of general management prescriptions, and
   indicates that local environmental variability should be taken into
   account in the conservation of semi-natural habitats.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {During the past decade, quantification of the pigment lipofuscin in the
   olfactory lobe cell masses (OLCM) has been successfully used for age
   determination of crustaceans. The aim of the current study was to
   quantify the amount of lipofuscin in European lobsters (Homarus gammarus
   L.) of known age and to determine the accuracy of lipofuscin as an age
   predictor. Lipofuscin was quantified by confocal fluorescence microscopy
   and image analysis of histological sections. Our results showed that age
   and OLCM lipofuscin were closely and linearly related (r(2) = 0.88).
   Furthermore, in contrast to earlier studies, age was also closely, but
   nonlinearly, related to carapace length (r(2) = 0.78). Comparison of
   lipofuscin and carapace length as age predictors nevertheless showed
   that lipofuscin produced significantly more accurate estimates of age
   than carapace length. The relatively small difference in the precision
   of age estimation between lipofuscin and carapace length emphasises the
   importance of evaluating the relationship between age and carapace
   length/lipofuscin in studies of populations with variable environmental
   conditions or demographic processes. It is possible that age, in
   specific situations, could be satisfactorily predicted on basis of
   measurements of size.},

Abstract = {Disease costs the Norwegian aquaculture industry approximately NOK 1
   billion (\$ 150000000) every year, and NOK 250000000 (\$ 36000000) is
   spent on vaccines each year by the industry. Many of the disease
   outbreaks take place during the first months of transfer to the sea
   sites. Thus, the aim of this project was to monitor physiological stress
   parameters as plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate in salmon smolts
   before and after regular well boat transports. The loading process was
   observed to be a more severe stressor than the transport itself. Only
   minor plasma cortisol increases were observed during unloading. In four
   out of five transports, plasma cortisol had returned to resting level at
   arrival. However in one, which showed an unusually high mortality rate
   during the first month after transfer to the sea, the plasma cortisol
   level remained high during unloading. The study showed that well boat
   transports seemed to have an important recovery function. Without this
   ability to recover between the stressors, as on- and unloading, the
   ability for salmon smolts to handle multiple stressors was reduced.
   Further, the present study seems to strengthen the fact that some of the
   increased mortality experienced at sea sites in Norway may be explained
   by handling and transport prior to deliverance of smolts. Care should be
   taken during commercial boat transports. Planning of well boat routes,
   and avoidance of high seas could contribute to minimise mortality
   experienced after transports. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   classification of some genera, after Doyen and Tschinkel (1982) and
   Doyen et al. (1989) are introduced as results of morphological
   comparative study. Rhypasma Pascoe, 1871 is transferred to the tribe

Abstract = {There are three crayfish species present in Latvia: the European noble
   crayfish (Astacus astacus), the narrow-clawed crayfish (Astacus
   leptodactylus), and the North-American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus
   leniusculus) species. Probably only noble crayfish are native and
   migrated into the country after the last glaciation. Narrow-clawed
   crayfish has also been present at least since the beginning of the
   20(th) century. In total there are current information on crayfish from
   258 localities in Latvia. Most of these localities are lakes (175), but
   many crayfish populations are also found in river and streams (66). A
   few populations are found in reservoirs, ponds and gravel-pits.
   The noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) is the dominant crayfish species
   and widely distributed in all regions of Latvia. 220 out of 258 crayfish
   localities contain only noble crayfish. The situation is much the same
   as in the 1960s, the most obvious change being that more noble crayfish
   populations are established in the area south of Riga. The narrow-clawed
   crayfish has expanded its distribution since the 1960s when it was
   reported in 13 localities. Current records include 34 populations and
   eight of these are coexisting with noble crayfish. Previously, the
   narrow-clawed crayfish was confined to the southern part of the country.
   The present distribution includes several populations around Riga and in
   other parts of the Vidzeme region. The signal crayfish was introduced to
   one small lake in 1983. In 2004 it is found in another three localities
   (two rivers and one gravel-pit) quite a distance from the first
   locality. This indicates stocking by man and not a natural dispersal.
   Probably the signal crayfish is more widespread than the current data
   show. Further in this paper, we present information on crayfish
   legislation, harvest and farming. The threats to the noble crayfish and
   the main objectives for crayfish conservation and use are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) migrate to seawater every
   summer for feeding and spend the rest of the year overwintering in fresh
   water. We investigated whether annual seawater migration is preceded by
   changes in hyposmoregulatory capacity, intermediary metabolism, and the
   plasma levels of hormones known to play a role in salmonid seawater
   preadaptation (smoltification). Wild, anadromous Arctic char were
   sampled in their overwintering lake in April and May and during the
   period of downstream migration in June. Our results demonstrate a
   fourfold seasonal increase in gill Na+/K+ ATPase activity, with maximum
   levels in descending migrants that also displayed prime
   hyposmoregulatory capacity. Hepatosomatic index and activities of key
   liver enzymes also increased during spring, indicating a general
   increase in liver metabolic capacity. These changes were accompanied by
   increased plasma cortisol and thyroxine levels, decreased plasma growth
   hormone levels, and unchanged plasma levels of insulin-like growth
   factor-I and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine. Our results indicate that wild,
   anadromous Arctic char resmoltify every spring, and this involves a
   shift from an energy-conserving overwintering state to a state where
   they become osmotically and metabolically prepared for their annual
   feeding migration to seawater.},

Title = {Can intra-specific variation in carnivore home-range size be explained
   using remote-sensing estimates of environmental productivity?},
Journal = {ECOSCIENCE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-75},
Abstract = {Carnivore home-range sizes vary profoundly between populations within a
   species. One commonly cited reason for this is variation in prey
   population density and environmental productivity. However, obtaining
   reliable measures of prey density in the field is both time and effort
   consuming. Therefore, a methodology that enabled scientists and managers
   to extrapolate home-range sizes across areas would be a valuable tool.
   So far, the potentials of different remote-sensing indices to represent
   environmental productivity have been poorly evaluated in this context.
   In this study, we have evaluated the utility of a readily available
   remote-sensing index, the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active
   Radiation absorbed by vegetation canopies (FPAR), to explain
   interpopulation variation in home-range size for 12 carnivore species.
   In multiple regression models, evaluated by the Bayesian Information
   Criterion (BIC), we found that the FPAR index added predictive power to
   the models for eight of the species. The explanatory power varied
   between 16\% and 71\% for the different species. We suggest that using
   remote-sensing indices such as FPAR to predict area specific home-range
   sizes for carnivores could potentially be a powerful tool, but that the
   methodology needs to be further developed in order to add more
   explanatory power for some species.},

Abstract = {To examine the immunological impacts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
   in an environmentally relevant way, we orally contaminated Arctic charr
   (Salvelinus alpinus) with Aroclor 1254. After contamination, fish were
   either fed (0 and 100 ing Aroclor 1254 kg(-1) fish wt) or fasted (0, 1,
   10, and 100 mg kg(-1)) to mimic cycles of feeding-fasting experienced by
   Arctic animals. After four months, PCB concentrations in muscle were the
   same in fasted and fed fish; however, PCBs in kidneys of fed fish were
   33 to 50\% of those in fasted fish. Arctic charr were exposed to
   Aeromonas salmonicida, the bacteria responsible for furunculosis, by
   cohabitation with infected conspecifics. Fasted fish had a significant
   trend toward lower survival with higher dose of PCBs from 68\% in
   controls to 48\% in treatment involving 100 mg kg(-1). Independent of
   PCB contamination, fed fish had the lowest survival; we attribute this
   to stress associated with establishing and maintaining feeding
   hierarchies. A significant decrease in the activity of lysozyme was
   observed in skin mucus, as was hemagglutination ability of a putative
   rhamnose lectin in fasted, but not in fed, PCB-treated fish. These
   results demonstrate the immunosuppressive effects of PCBs on Arctic
   charr, and they illustrate the importance of considering environmentally
   relevant nutritional status in ecotoxicological Studies.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of Sr-90, Po-210 and Pb-210 in lichen and reindeer were
   studied in central (Ostre Namdal) and southern Norway (Vaga) during
   2000-2003. The study focussed on potential differences in concentrations
   of these nuclides in reindeer of different ages. Concentrations of Sr-90
   in bones of similar to 10 year old adult females were about 40\% higher
   than those in calves' antlers (Sr-90 concentrations in antlers and bones
   of calves are similar), while the available data from Vaga suggest that
   Sr-90 concentrations in reindeer calves decreased with an effective
   ecological half-time of 9.03 +/- 0.06 years during 1988-2002.
   Furthermore, Sr-90 concentrations were 50-80\% higher in bone of
   reindeer of a similar age from Vaga compared to those from Ostre Namdal.
   Concentrations of Po-210 and Pb-210 in muscle and liver tissues were
   comparable to those reported for reindeer in other Nordic areas, with no
   significant difference in Po-210 and Pb-210 concentrations between
   adults and calves or between reindeer from the two different study

Abstract = {Transfer of Cs-137 in the soil-plant/lichen-reindeer food chain was
   studied in central (Ostre Namdal) and southern Nor-way (Vaga) during
   2000-2003. Reindeer from these areas have been continuously subjected to
   countermeasure application since the 1986 Chernobyl accident. In both
   areas no decline in Cs-137 concentrations was detectable in reindeer
   slaughtered in autumn since 1995, or in reindeer slaughtered in winter
   since 1998-1999. Seasonal differences in Cs-137 concentrations in
   reindeer have been less pronounced in recent years, with Cs-137
   concentrations occasionally higher in autumn than in winter.
   Soil-to-plant Cs-137 transfer was significantly higher in Ostre Namdal
   than in Vaga. Climatic influences on lichen growth and abundance, and on
   soil properties that influence the availability of Cs-137 for plant
   uptake, are hypothesized to have a larger impact on long-term transfer
   of radiocaesium in the soil-plant/lichen-reindeer food chain than has
   been previously observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of Cs-137 were determined in 747 lynxes killed in Norway
   during the period 1986-2001. Highly variable Cs-137 concentrations and
   aggregated transfer coefficient values were observed, probably caused by
   variable Cs-137 concentrations in prey and the lynx's extensive home
   ranges and roaming distances. Adult lynxes had higher Cs-137
   concentrations than sub-adults, and lynxes killed in regions with
   extensive reindeer grazing areas were more contaminated than others. A
   model with Cs-137 deposition density, the year lynxes were killed, age,
   and extent of reindeer grazing area accounted for 50\% of the
   variability in observed Cs-137 concentrations. The analyses were
   equivocal regarding the influence of stomach content on Cs-137
   concentrations in lynx muscle, i.e., on the lynx's specialization in
   prey species. Gender was not significant. Information on caesium
   retention in lynx and better estimates of deposition densities in
   lynxes' home ranges are important for further elucidation of factors
   influencing Cs-137 contamination in lynxes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The effect of temperature and sampling interval on the accuracy of food
   consumption estimates based on stomach contents was Studied using
   simulation. Three temporal patterns of feeding were considered
   (scattered throughout the day, one 5 h period or two 5 It periods) and
   gastric evacuation was modelled according to published values. Sampling
   intervals of 3 It Rave reasonable food consumption estimates (2 to 19\%
   error) at all temperatures. Comparably, sampling intervals as large as
   12 h gave reasonable estimates of food consumption (1 to 20\% error)
   when temperature was set to less than or equal to 10degrees C. At
   temperatures <5degrees C. even 24 It intervals (equivalent to one daily
   sampling) provided reasonable estimates of daily food consumption (2 to
   19\% error) for all but the hi-hest gastric evacuation rate combined
   with one daily feeding period (47\% error). The temperature effect on
   estimation error resulted front diminishing temporal fluctuations in
   stomach contents with slower aastric evacuation rates. It follows that
   sampling effort may be considerably minimized when estimating food
   consumption from stomach contents during periods with low temperatures
   such as the winter time experienced by temperate fishes. (C) 2005 The

Abstract = {We report on the body size and mass and egg size and mass of the Chinese
   grouse ( Bonasa sewerzowi), one of the least known grouse in the world.
   Although reported to be the smallest grouse in the world, not enough
   data have been available to substantiate this claim. We document that
   the Chinese grouse is, in fact, the smallest grouse in the world. It
   shows significant changes in body mass between the reproductive and
   nonreproductive season ( males average 310 g in the reproductive season
   and 341 g in the nonreproductive season; females averaged 338 and 315 g,
   respectively). Egg mass averages 20.6 - 21.6 g and shows significant
   annual variation. The Chinese grouse shows some of the highest relative
   reproductive investment among grouse, both for egg mass ( 6.1 - 6.9\% of
   female body mass) and clutch mass ( 38 - 43\%).},

Abstract = {Variation in size of home range is among the most important parameters
   required for effective conservation and management of a species.
   However, the fact that home ranges can vary widely within a species
   makes data transfer between study areas difficult. Home ranges of
   Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx vary by a factor of 10 between different study
   areas in Europe. This study aims to try and explain this variation in
   terms of readily available indices of prey density and environmental
   productivity. On an individual scale we related the sizes of 52 home
   ranges, derived from 23 (9:14 male:female) individual resident lynx
   obtained from south-eastern Norway. with an index of density of roe deer
   Capreolus capreolus. This index was obtained from the density of
   harvested roe deer within the municipalities covered by the lynx home
   ranges. We found a significant negative relationship between harvest
   density and home-range size for both sexes. On a European level we
   related the sizes of 111 lynx (48:63 male: female) from 10 study sites
   to estimates derived from remote sensing of environmental productivity
   and seasonality. A multiple linear regression model indicated that
   productivity of the study site had a clear negative relationship with
   home-range size. At both scales, sex emerged as a significant
   explanatory variable with males having larger home ranges than than
   females. In addition, the size of male home-ranges increased faster with
   decreasing prey density than for females. These analyses support widely
   held predictions that variation in home-range size is due to variation
   in prey densiry.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {297},

Abstract = {Despite contrasting population trends ranging from -3 to + 11\% per
   annum, the annual survival rates of Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica
   in the 5 colonies spanning the species range in the east Atlantic were
   virtually identical over a 10 to 15 yr period, giving no support to the
   hypothesis that variation in population growth rates is driven by adult
   survival. The extent to which survival varied among years differed
   markedly between colonies. Similarities between colonies in the patterns
   of inter-annual variation in survival did not reflect similarities in
   wintering areas, as indicated by recoveries of ringed birds, nor the
   geographic proximity of the colonies. However, survival in 4 of the 5
   colonies correlated with sea surface temperatures around each colony 2
   yr earlier. The relationship between survival and sea temperature was
   positively correlated with the effects of sea temperature on recruitment
   of the Atlantic puffin's main prey species, the lesser sandeel Ammodytes
   marinus, the herring Clupea harengus and the capelin Mallotus villosus.},

Abstract = {Estimates of the intensity and abundance of species provide essential
   data for ecological, evolutionary and epidemiological studies of
   gastrointestinal nematode communities. These estimates are typically
   derived from the species composition of adult males when only males have
   readily scorable species-specific morphological traits. Such estimation
   assumes that all species in the community have the same adult sex ratio.
   We evaluated this assumption for the trichostrongyle de nematodes
   Ostertagia gruehneri and Marshallagia marshalli in infracommunities in
   Svalbard reindeer by identifying to species adult females using a
   polymerase chain reaction assay. The proportion of males was found to be
   slightly higher in O. gruehneri than in H. marshalli. Evidence for
   seasonal variation and density dependence in the adult sex ratio was
   only found for O. gruehneri. Possible demographic mechanisms for such
   sex ratio variation are discussed, and stochastic models that generate
   density-dependent sex ratios proposed. Sex ratio variation caused
   substantial bias in some male-based estimates of intensity of infection,
   while Substantial and consistent bias in estimates of abundances was
   only evident in late winter samples. Our results suggest that estimating
   sex ratios can be particularly important in individual host level
   studies of nematode species of low abundance.},

Abstract = {Movements of 20 radio-tagged wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr
   were studied 1.3 km downstream of a hydropower station. Ten parr were
   free-ranging and ten were restricted to an area near the river bank by a
   75 m(2) rectangular containment pen that was flooded at high flow, but
   dry at low flow except for a small refuge at the low end. The positions
   of contained parr were continuously recorded within a four-cell uniform
   grid by continuous data logging, while free-ranging fish were positioned
   by manual tracking four times per day. River discharge was manipulated
   to run five pseudo-replicated series of three step changes from 30 to 70
   to 110 m(3) s(-1), with slow (2 h) and rapid (0 h) increase and decrease
   in discharge, as well as during day and night. No differences in
   movements or home ranges (mean 2770 m(2) +/- 1759 SD) were detected
   related to manipulated discharge variations or time of day or night for
   the free-ranging parr. No free-ranging parr were stranded during rapid
   flow reductions. In the containment pen, the parr distributed themselves
   relatively evenly among the cells. They moved significantly more at
   changing than at stable flows. In the containment pen, most of the fish
   that were stranded were observed during rapid flow reductions at night.
   Rapid reductions in water flow may cause increased mortality in large
   parr in shallow habitats if movements are restricted; however, rapid
   fluctuations did not appear to influence movements or cause stranding by
   free-ranging Atlantic salmon parr, which moved considerable distances
   regardless of discharge. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

   specific energy were observed corresponding to removal of low-energy
   individuals. By using energetic modelling we demonstrated that metabolic
   processes or feeding could not be responsible for the shifts in the
   shape of the energy distributions and that negative-energy-dependent
   mortality was the most likely explanation for the observations. No
   changes in mean size of the fish or in the shape of the size
   distributions were observed between successive sampling periods,
   indicating that mortality was linked to levels of storage energy rather
   than to body size per se. Our study indicated a critical body energy
   level for survival of juvenile salmon at approximately 4400-4800
   J(.)g(-1), corresponding to a depletion of storage lipids.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews recent advances in our understanding of factors
   influencing the marine production of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
   Population abundance has declined during the last 30 years because of
   decreased marine growth rate, survival-rate, and production of
   multi-sea-winter fish. Mortality appears density-independent, indicating
   that the marine abundance is beneath the carrying capacity for the
   species. Correlations between the North Atlantic Oscillation winter
   index for the post-smolt year and production variables indicate that
   unfavourable climatic conditions are partly responsible for the decline.
   Low sea temperature may be the ultimate reason for the poor salmon
   production, whereas predation is one proximate mortality factor, which
   is probably both size and temperature dependent. Low growth rate during
   cold years was associated with low sea age at maturity and small salmon,
   contrary to the common observation that fast growth leads to young age
   at maturity. It is suggested that low water temperature may stimulate
   lipid storage relative to protein production and that the energy density
   needed to attain sexual maturity is lower in small than in large salmon.
   Future research should focus on the relationships between smolt age and
   (or) size and adult age and (or) size, and the association among water
   temperature, growth rate, growth efficiency, and age at sexual maturity.},

Abstract = {Long-term variation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocks was analyzed
   in two Barents Sea rivers, the Teno and Naatamojoki, that represent the
   northernmost distribution area of the species. In contrast to most of
   the North Atlantic area, these rivers are among a group of northern
   salmon rivers that, despite wide annual variation in catches,
   demonstrate no consistent trend for declining abundance. Variations in
   abundance were generally synchronous for the total catch and numbers of
   1-sea-winter (1SW) and 2SW salmon during period of 1972-2003. Part of
   the variation observed in catches could be related to ocean climate
   conditions as the mean seawater temperature in July during the year of
   smoltification for the Kola section of the Barents Sea was significantly
   related to numbers of 1SW, 2SW, and 3SW salmon in the large River Teno.
   In contrast, NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) indices were not related
   to salmon catches. The latest increase (1999-2001) in salmon catches in
   these rivers reflects both temporarily improved oceanic conditions and
   past management measures affecting offshore, coastal, and river
   fisheries.},

Abstract = {Native European freshwater crayfish (Astacida, Decapoda) are under
   severe pressure from habitat alteration, the introduction of
   nonindigenous species, and epizootic disease. Crayfish plague, an acute
   disease of freshwater crayfish caused by the fungus-like agent
   Aphanomyces astaci, was introduced into Europe in the mid-nineteenth
   century and is responsible for ongoing widespread epizootic mortality in
   native European populations. We reviewed recent developments and current
   practices in the field of crayfish pathology. The severity of crayfish
   plague has resulted in an overemphasis on it. Diagnostic methods for
   detecting fungi and fungal-like agents, and sometimes culturing them,
   are frequently the sole techniques used to investigate disease outbreaks
   in European freshwater crayfish. Consequently, the causes of a
   significant proportion of outbreaks are undetermined. Pathogen groups
   well known for causing disease in other crustaceans, such as viruses and
   rickettsia-like organisms, are poorly understood or unknown in European
   freshwater crayfish. Moreover the pathogenic significance of some
   long-known pathogens of European freshwater crayfish remains obscure.
   For effective management of this culturally significant and threatened
   resource, there is an urgent need for researchers, diagnosticians, and
   resource managers to address the issue of disease in European freshwater
   crayfish from a broader perspective than has been applied previously.},

Abstract = {A model based on proximate considerations of life histories of Atlantic
   salmon, Salmo salar, was examined for its applicability to fit the
   variation in life-history of wild Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus,
   based on a qualitative assessment of information related to growth and
   lipid dynamics of Arctic charr. The original salmon model is discussed
   in context of modifications required to account for added complexities
   in the life history of Arctic charr in relation to anadromy versus
   residency. A study from North Norway shows that individual charr that
   emigrate from the lakes to the sea, maintain a high growth rate in the
   lake in late summer and early autumn compared with resident fish. Their
   relatively low lipid level in autumn combined with a high rate of change
   of lipid during winter was associated with postponement of maturation in
   the anadromous individuals. Individuals that remain resident in the lake
   arrested growth in autumn. Their high lipid level in autumn combined
   with a low rate of change of lipid during winter was associated with
   maturation the following summer, without emigration from freshwater.
   Results from this and other related studies show similarities with the
   model derived from lipid and growth dynamics of Atlantic salmon. The
   adjusted charr model illustrates possible proximate explanations for the
   high variation in life-history strategies of Arctic charr. However, the
   model does not account for the characteristic return migration of
   immature charr into freshwater several weeks after their entry to the
   sea. The proximate physiological stimulus for this movement of immature
   fish is not entirely clear.},

Abstract = {1. Knowledge of the functional response of predators to prey densities
   conditions our understanding of food webs. Such links are still poorly
   understood within the higher trophic levels of marine ecosystems.
   2. We present the first field study recording the foraging effort and
   foraging yield of a seabird (the Great Cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo)
   as well as the abundance and quality of prey within its foraging area.
   3. We confirm that Great Cormorants foraging off West-Greenland show the
   highest foraging performance recorded for a marine predator (between 17
   and 41 g fish caught per minute underwater). Former work suggests that
   such high foraging yield should be based upon the exploitation of
   extremely profitable prey patches.
   4. Contrary to this hypothesis, average prey abundances estimated within
   the foraging areas of the cormorants were low (0.03-0.09 prey m(-2),
   depending on methods), as was the average calorific value of the prey
   items (4.2 kJ g(-1)).
   5. Our study suggests that Great Cormorants remain highly successful
   predators even when exploiting modest prey resources. These findings
   have implications for our understanding of predator-prey relationships,
   and for the management of Great Cormorant populations.},

Abstract = {Most exploitation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is restricted to
   ``homewater fisheries{''}. which operate close to or within the rivers
   of origin of the stocks, but two ``distant-water fisheries{''} are
   permitted to operate off the west coast of Greenland and in the
   Norwegian Sea, and take salmon from a large number of rivers over a wide
   geographical area. Providing robust quantitative catch advice for these
   mixed-stock fisheries depends upon the ability to forecast stock
   abundance for about 2000 salmon river-stocks around the North Atlantic,
   more than 1500 of which are in Europe. A ``run-reconstruction{''} model
   is presented for estimating the historic pre-fishery abundance (PFA) of
   salmon for countries or regions around the Northeast Atlantic, based
   upon catch data and estimates of non-reporting rates and exploitation
   rates. These estimates are then used to develop predictive models of PFA
   on the basis of estimates of the egg deposition, derived from the
   run-reconstruction model and various environmental data. Although the
   selected environmental indices correlated with the PFA of both southern
   and northern European stock complexes, the main statistical significance
   in the forecast models was provided by temporal trends in the PFA.
   Clearly. such a model is only tenable in the short term. and will be
   poor at predicting a major change in stock status. Alternative
   approaches, based upon juvenile production indices and including
   Bayesian techniques, are therefore being considered. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Management of a group of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations that
   are harvested together in the ocean, but separately in freshwater, is
   looked at from a genetic perspective. A model that estimates total
   effective population size from local effective population sizes and
   migration patterns is applied to a system often salmon populations in
   the Sognefjorden district, western Norway. This population system is
   dominated numerically by the River Laerdalselva population, which may
   act as a source of migrants into nine smaller populations in a
   ``source-sink{''} metapopulation. The total effective population size of
   this system is to a large extent dependent on the effective population
   size of the Laerdalselva population, but the contribution per spawner to
   the total effective population size is greater for a fish from the
   smaller populations than for a fish from Laerdalselva. The results are

Abstract = {Two separate field experiments were performed in the U.S.A. and Norway
   with stocked Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. In the Norwegian experiment,
   the offspring of early-spawning fish which had larger eggs and emerged a
   few days before offspring of later spawning fish had consistently higher
   survival rates. In the U.S.A. experiment, stream sections with higher
   proportions of favourable foraging locations during the critical period
   (the transition from dependence on maternally-derived yolk reserves to
   independent feeding) had lower loss rates of fish stocked as unfed fry.
   These results provide support for the critical period concept (CPC) in
   Atlantic salmon, underscores the utility of a manipulative approach to
   achieve further advances in knowledge of Atlantic salmon ecology and
   provide additional guidance to management and restoration. A
   mechanistic, conceptual model for density dependence is presented to
   identify important knowledge gaps that remain to further evaluate the
   importance of the CPC for Atlantic salmon population regulation. (C)

Abstract = {The mean home-range size of the Javan Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus bartelsi) on
   Java was estimated to be ca. 400 ha based on three different methods.
   The distance between nests of neighboring pairs was ca. 3 km in
   Gede-Pangrango and 2 km in the Salak Mountains. In the Halinum
   Mountains, the mean distance between territories was 1.8 km.
   Radiotracking of one adult male indicated a home-range size of 300 ha in
   the nonbreeding season. This finding Suggested that earlier population
   estimates probably were too low, as they were based on home-range
   estimates of 2000-5000 ha per pair depending on habitat quality. The
   species should Still be considered endangered, as it is threatened both
   from habitat loss and illegal hunting.},

Abstract = {Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a major part in
   the activation of the vertebrate immune system. In addition, they also
   appear to function as cues for mate choice. In mammals especially,
   several kinds of MHC-dependent mate choice have been hypothesized and
   observed. These include choice of mates that share no or few alleles
   with the choosing individual, choice of mates with alleles that differ
   as much as possible from the choosing individual, choice of heterozygous
   mates, choice of certain genotypes and choice of rare alleles. We
   investigated these different aspects of mate choice in relation to MHC
   in a lekking bird species, the great snipe (Gallinago media). We found
   no evidence for MHC disassortative mating, no preference for males with
   many MHC alleles and no preference for rare alleles. However, we did
   find that some allelic lineages were more often found in males with
   mating success than in males without mating success. Females do not seem
   to use themselves as references for the MHC-dependent mate choice,
   rather they seem to prefer males with certain allele types. We speculate
   that these alleles may be linked to resistance to common parasites.},

Title = {Adaptive regulation of body reserves in reindeer, Rangifer tarandus: a
   feeding experiment},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {107},
Number = {3},
Pages = {583-591},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The costs and benefits of body reserves fluctuate according to
   predictable factors such as season and life-cycle stage. Theory suggests
   that individuals at any time should regulate their body reserves
   according to the current balance between costs and benefits. Most
   studies on adaptive body mass regulation have been done on small
   passerine birds. In large vertebrates the costs associated with body
   reserves are assumed to be small and the reserves of these species are
   therefore thought to be dictated by environmental limitations. In this
   study we present experimental evidence for adaptive body mass regulation
   in female semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer t, tarandus). The risk of
   starvation in this species is highest in late winter. During snow melt
   this risk is reduced and the females should direct their effort towards
   the protection of their new born calf. To test how these seasonal and
   life-cycle changes are related to body mass regulation, we conducted a
   crossed experiment with two treatments where females were fed ad libitum
   during winter and spring respectively. During winter, the females from
   the fed group gained on average 12\% of their initial body weight while
   the females from natural pastures lost on average 6\% of their initial
   body weight. This strong response to winter feeding had no effect on
   reproductive performance, and the previously fed females lost their
   excess of body reserves during feeding in spring. This suggests that
   body reserves during winter primarily is used as an insurance against
   stochastic periods of starvation and that the females regulate their
   body reserves down to a set point in spring when the risk is reduced. We
   found however a positive correlation between initial female body weight
   and reproductive performance suggesting a close relationship between
   body weight and intrinsic individual qualities.},

Abstract = {We recorded the observed and actual swimming speeds of Atlantic salmon
   and sea trout post-smolts in a Norwegian fjord system, and initiated
   studies on the orientation mechanisms of the post-smolts. We tracked
   Atlantic salmon and sea trout with acoustic transmitters for up to 14 h
   after release. The actual swimming speed and direction of a fish
   relative to the ground is the vector sum of the observed movements of
   the fish and the movements of the water. We determined actual swimming
   speeds and directions of the post-smolts, which reflect their real
   swimming capacities and orientation, by corrections for the speed and
   direction of the water current. The post-smolts were actively swimming.
   The observed direction of movement was dependent on the actual movement
   of the fish and not the water current. Water currents were not
   systematically used as an orientation cue either in Atlantic salmon or
   sea trout, as the actual movements were random compared to the direction
   of the water current. The actual movement of sea trout were in all
   compass directions, with no systematic pattern. The Atlantic salmon also
   moved in all compass directions, but with the lowest frequency of actual
   movement towards the fjord.},

   2. All winter-acclimatised fish maintained positive growth and a

   3. Growth and food consumption varied significantly among populations.
   Winter-acclimatised fish from a Northern population had a higher

Title = {Spatial organization of reproductive Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus:
   responses to changes in spatial and temporal availability of prey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {73},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1056-1068},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. Home range size, spatial organization and territoriality of
   reproductive Arctic foxes were studied during the summer. The influence
   of spatial distribution and availability of the main prey was
   investigated in order to evaluate whether the spatial organization of
   Arctic foxes was coherent with key predictions of the resource
   dispersion hypotheses (RDH). The RDH includes the spatial
   characteristics of resource abundance, while there is also growing
   attention to the importance of the temporal characteristics of resource
   abundance. Hence the role of temporal and spatio-temporal predictability
   of prey explaining carnivore spatial organization was also investigated
   in this study.
   2. The study was conducted on Svalbard; a simple High-Arctic terrestrial
   ecosystem which allowed unique estimates of prey abundance. The main
   prey of the Arctic fox (Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus
   platyrhynchus, seabirds Alcidae and Procellariidae and geese Anseridae)
   was surveyed systematically. These surveys revealed highly contrasting
   patterns in prey abundance within the terrestrial ecosystem.
   3. Arctic fox summer home ranges varied in size (4-60 km(2)), as well as
   in overlap (17-76\%). The diverse spatial organization covaried with
   spatial and temporal patterns in prey abundance. Small home ranges (10
   +/- 5.6 km(2)) with large overlap (76 +/- 19.6\%) were characteristic
   for coastal areas where prey was concentrated in small patches and
   predictable both in space and time. Medium home ranges (23 +/- 4.2
   km(2)) and overlap (50 +/- 6.6\%) occurred inland where prey was clumped
   in larger patches and less predictable. Large home ranges (52 +/- 8.4
   km(2)) with little overlap (17 +/- 3.5\%) occurred inland where prey was
   widely scattered and unpredictable.
   4. Spatial dispersion and richness of prey resources explained most of
   the variation in Arctic fox spatial organization. The RDH framework
   could be used to explain the presence of relaxed territoriality found in
   this study. We suggest that the observed absence of more permanent
   social groups is due to the extremely severe winter conditions which
   force juvenile individuals to disperse from the natal area during the
   first winter.
   5. Predictability of resources was an additional significant factor
   affecting both home-range size and overlap. Resource predictability
   captures the degree to which an animal can depend on its environment to
   offer suitable and secure living conditions over time.
   6. This study emphasize the need to incorporate both spatial and
   temporal characteristics of resource distribution in order to fully
   understand the diversity of spatial arrangements among carnivores.},

Abstract = {1. Variance in competitive ability among males should lead to a
   corresponding skew in reproductive success. Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar) males form dominance hierarchies during spawning, such that the
   dominant individuals are predicted to realize the highest reproductive
   success. However, the degree to which this occurs depends on various
   genetic and environmental factors.
   2. We investigated the influence of the aquaculture environment on male
   Atlantic salmon behaviour during spawning in three experiments involving
   groups of either purely farmed or wild males, or mixed groups composed
   of equal numbers of farmed and wild fish. The objective of this study
   was to compare and contrast the formation of dominance hierarchies and
   relationships between aggression, courtship and spawning success in
   farmed and wild males.
   3. Although farmed males did not establish dominance hierarchies as
   effectively as wild males, they courted and spawned with females in
   larger numbers and they frequently failed to release sperm when females
   released eggs.
   4. Dominance structures established by wild males led to reliable
   behavioural correlates of spawning success; this was not the case among
   farmed males.
   5. From the risk-assessment perspective, farmed males can be expected to
   have reduced spawning success, although the degree of reproductive
   inferiority of farmed relative to wild males depends upon rearing
   environment and the populations under consideration.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) are known to affect the immune systems
   of wildlife, and in this study we assessed the relationship between
   blood concentration of different OCs and measurements relevant to immune
   status and function in arctic breeding glaucous gulls (Larus
   hyperboreus). In 1997 and 2001, we counted white blood cells
   (heterophils and lymphocytes) from blood smears, and in 2000 and 2001 we
   injected two novel nonpathogenic antigens (diphtheria and tetanus
   toxoids) into the pectoral muscle of gulls and measured the primary
   antibody responses. We then related these measurements to the blood
   concentrations of three pesticides (hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB],
   oxychlordane, and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) and seven
   different polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCB 101, 99, 118, 153,
   138, 180, and 170). There were significant or near significant positive
   relationships (0.1 > p > 0.001) between most persistent OCs and the
   levels of heterophils in the blood for both sexes in 1997 and for male
   gulls in 2001. Similarly, levels of all persistent OCs and lymphocytes
   were positively related (0.1 > p > 0.001) in both sexes in 1997. This
   suggests that OCs are causing alterations to immune systems, which may
   decrease their efficiency and make the birds more susceptible to
   parasites and diseases. In female gulls, the antibody response to the
   diphtheria toxoid was significant and negative for HCB (p <0.01) and
   weaker, but significant, for oxychlordane (p <0.05), suggesting that OCs
   were causing an impairment of the humoral immunity. Various OCs have
   been linked to negative effects in our study population, including
   decreased survival and reproduction, and this study suggests that such
   compounds also affect immune status and function.},

Abstract = {We examined the hypothesis that Steller's eiders, Polysticta stelleri
   (Pallas, 1769), in good body condition avoided nutritious and abundant
   prey that were intermediate hosts of acanthocephalans, while birds in
   poor condition accepted the long-term costs of parasitism to minimize
   the short-term risk of starvation. We predicted that the intensity of
   the acanthocephalan Polymorphus phippsi (Kostylev, 1922) should be
   positively related to the intake of intermediate hosts and that the
   intake of such prey should be negatively related to body condition. All
   Steller's eiders were infected (2-1142 parasites/bird). Only the intake
   of the amphipod Gammarus oceanicus (Segerstrale, 1947), a known
   intermediate host of P. phippsi, was significantly related to parasite
   intensity. Juvenile Steller's eiders were in poorer condition than
   adults and fed more on amphipods (44\% vs. 9\% of total biomass). On the
   contrary, adults preferred isopods (26\% of total biomass vs. 12\% for
   juveniles), which were less abundant than littoral amphipods but were
   not intermediate hosts of P. phippsi. Moreover, in juveniles there was a
   negative relationship between body condition and the proportion of
   amphipods in the diet. Hence, juveniles in poor body condition consumed
   potentially infected prey while adults and juveniles in good condition
   avoided such prey. The cost of avoiding littoral amphipods was probably
   a lower energy return per unit feeding effort.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {677-687},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Whether cohort effects can be retrieved in adult phenotypes depends on
   the possibility for individuals to compensate for a good or bad start in
   life. This ability to compensate may itself depend on the environment
   and on individual sex. In large polygynous ungulates, male reproductive
   success relies more on body size than the reproductive success of
   females, which makes them more sensitive to a bad start in life. Based
   on current theories of life history evolution and sexual selection, we
   tested the following predictions in a moose population: 1) cohort
   effects and year effects occur in both male and female adult body mass,
   but due to 2) compensatory growth, cohort effects tend to fade away with
   the individual's age; and 3) males are more sensitive to cohort effects
   than females. In support of the first prediction, we found that density
   and climate during the year-of-birth and the year-of-harvest affected
   moose body mass in both sexes. However, the magnitude of the effects of
   environmental conditions at birth on adult body mass decreased with
   increasing age, but less so in males than in females. Thus, as expected
   based on our third prediction, environmental conditions early in life
   were more influential on adult body mass of males compared to females.
   Such a result supports the existence of sex-specific life history
   tactics, with males maximising growth rate and females rather
   trading-off growth for reproduction.},

Title = {How far can a hawk's beard fly? Measuring and modelling the dispersal of
   Crepis praemorsa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {92},
Number = {5},
Pages = {747-757},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1 We measured and modelled the dispersal of a wind-dispersed herb, the
   leafless hawk's beard (Crepis praemorsa, Asteraceae), using a
   combination of measurement techniques, selected empirical models and
   mechanistic models originally developed for trees.
   2 Dispersal was measured by releasing individual seeds and by placing
   seed traps around an experimentally created point source of seeding
   plants. Dispersal distances varied considerably between the experiments.
   In the seed releases, dispersal distances were positively related to
   horizontal wind speed (linear regression, P < 0.001) and, under
   favourable conditions, many seeds dispersed over several metres, with a
   few at > 30 m.
   3 Four empirical models (the inverse power (IP), the negative
   exponential (NE), Bullock \& Clarke's mixed model (MIX) and Clark et
   al.'s 2Dt model) were fitted to the data. IP and NE models often failed
   to accommodate the shape of the empirical distribution of dispersal
   distances, and the MIX model, although extremely flexible, tended to
   overfit the data. The 2Dt model was, however, flexible and realistic in
   each experiment. Nevertheless, the parameter values for all of the
   empirical models varied dramatically between experiments; no set of
   parameter values predicted the observed dispersal distances under all
   conditions.
   4 Two mechanistic models (Greene \& Johnson's analytical model (GJ) and
   Nathan et al.'s individual-based simulation model (NSN)), originally
   developed for trees, were parameterized using independent data and
   parameter values from the literature. Although the NSN model provided a
   poor fit for the seed trap experiment, it performed almost as well as
   the best empirical models in the seed release experiments. Its
   predictions were further improved by including convection, and predicted
   dispersal > 30 m corresponded closely with our observations. The
   prediction of low (< 1\%) dispersal > 200 m requires further validation.
   5 We conclude that dispersal models for wind-dispersed trees can be
   adapted for herbs with different dimensions and diaspore
   characteristics. Mechanistic simulations are superior because they are
   robust to environmental heterogeneity, as well as being informative in
   terms of understanding and predicting the effects of species
   characteristics and ecological factors on dispersal distances. Future
   empirical studies are needed at a wide range of environmental
   conditions, with careful measurement of conditions such as the strength
   and variability of horizontal and vertical wind speeds.},

Abstract = {Thirty Atlantic salmon salar parr (mean 135 mm total length, L-T) in the
   River Alta, Norway, were radio-tagged and tracked during 11-13 day
   period. The parr stayed within defined home ranges with a 95\%
   probability of localization within an average area of 1286 m(2)
   (241-3484 m(2)). On average, each parr had overlapping home ranges with
   7(.)7 other parr, and the overlap between pairs of fish covered on
   average 24\% of their home range areas. Mean length of the river stretch
   used was 90 m (22-383 m). On average, during 38\% (16-77\%) of the
   tracking surveys, the fish had moved >10 m since the previous survey.
   Mean total distance moved during the whole study was 402 m (208-862 m).
   The Atlantic salmon were most often recorded in riffles, but 27\% of the
   parr alternated between riffles and pools. The extensive movements,
   flexible habitat utilization and relatively large home ranges, together
   with the fact that all the parr had home ranges partly overlapping with
   other radio-tagged parr, indicate a flexible and variable behaviour and,
   thereby, a more complex social structure than a rigid defence of a fixed
   territory. Thus, Atlantic salmon production seems not to be limited by
   the highest potential number of territories for large parr in a given
   area. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Abstract = {We used microsatellite marker data taken from Scandinavian brown bear
   (Ursus arctos) tissue samples collected by hunters and biologists to
   estimate population genetic parameters important for bear management.
   Specifically, we show evidence of a small effective population size
   (N-e=44.8; 95\% CI: 30.9 to 73.2) and low rates of immigration ((m) over
   cap = 0.01; 95\% CI: 0.00 to 0.05) into the brown bear population along
   the southern edge of their range in Scandinavia. The ratio of genetic
   effective size to population size is approximately 0.06-0.14, which
   falls within the range of values found in previous studies of brown
   bears. The large confidence intervals around the immigration estimate
   reflect considerable uncertainty. Nonetheless, these values deserve
   attention because they are near thresholds of short-term management
   concern and worthy of long-term monitoring. If the genetic effective
   size remains this small and immigration remains low, then this
   population could be subject to the loss of fitness as a consequence of
   inbreeding effects.},

Abstract = {To investigate patterns of plant defence, a study was conducted on 13
   tree species in Botswana. We tested the hypotheses that (1) shoots on
   small, young trees are more defended than shoots at the same height on
   tall, mature individuals and (2) shoots within browsing height are more
   defended than shoots above the reach of browsers, on mature trees. Plant
   traits studied were total phenolics, tannin activity, nitrogen (N),
   acid-detergent fibre (ADF), and degree of spinescence (in three
   species). We found some support for the first hypothesis. Overall young
   trees had a significantly higher concentration of total phenolics than
   mature trees and on species level these differences were significant for
   three of the 13 species. However, we found no differences in tannin
   activity, spinescence or ADF concentration between young and mature
   trees, and four species had higher levels of N in young trees,
   suggesting higher overall palatability. Contrary to our second
   hypothesis, shoots within browsing height were less chemically defended
   (total phenolics and tannin activity) than shoots above browsing height
   in six of 13 species. Two species had less ADF in lower shoots, and no
   significant differences were found in N or spinescence for any species.
   This study included a broad range of tree species at two sites and the
   results indicate that general theories of plant defence, originating
   from boreal and northern temperate forests, cannot be simply applied to
   savanna ecosystems.},

Abstract = {African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) bulls alternate between living within
   large mixed-sex herds, and living solitarily, or in small single-sex
   groups, as `bachelors'. Using radio-telemetry, we show that bulls in
   northern Chobe National Park, Botswana, spend the early dry season as
   bachelors, but switch to herd attendance in the later dry season. Bulls
   may move between different mixed herds at this time, but are very rarely
   found as bachelors. As bachelors they are found more often in Baikaiea
   woodland, away from the floodplain grassland and adjacent habitats, than
   are herds during the same period. This pattern of herd affiliation
   differs from that found in studies elsewhere in Africa. It seems most
   likely that it results from a combination of seasonal mating
   opportunities; foraging preferences and seasonal forage availability;
   and predation avoidance, in turn determined largely by the highly
   seasonal, semi-arid climate.},

Abstract = {We tested the effect of a large ungulate carcass on boreal forest
   biodiversity by contrasting the local abundance and diversity of
   Coleoptera around a roe deer Capreolus capreolus carcass and in a
   control plot, between 8 August and 3 September 2003, in southern Norway.
   The two plots differed both in occurrence and richness of species, which
   were almost double at the carcass plot, although the diversity indices
   were similar. The higher evenness of the control plot compensated for
   its lower number of species, probably because the carcass plot was a
   disturbed area, colonized by many species, which were represented by few
   individuals. The number of beetles captured each day correlated
   positively with temperature at the control plot, but not at the carcass
   plot, indicating that the presence of an abundant and concentrated
   resource increased the local activity of Coleoptera. The carcass is
   likely to create a particular microclimate, which could partly buffer
   against extremes of air-temperature variation. These preliminary results
   indicate that ungulate carcasses have a significant ecological impact,
   which should be further investigated to improve the management and
   restoration of European boreal forest ecosystems.},

Title = {The importance of ice cover for energy turnover in juvenile Atlantic
   salmon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {73},
Number = {5},
Pages = {959-966},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. Under benign laboratory tank conditions we compared food consumption
   and metabolism of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) juveniles exposed to
   simulated ice cover (darkness) with fish in natural short, 6 h light,
   day length (without ice). Three different populations along an ice-cover
   gradient were tested (59degreesN-70degreesN).
   2. Resting metabolism was on average 30\% lower under simulated ice
   cover (6.6 J g(-1) day(-1)) than under natural day length (9.4 J g(-1)
   day(-1)), and the response was similar for all populations. Northern
   salmon grew equally well in dark and light conditions, whereas the
   southern grew significantly poorer in the dark. Fish from all
   populations fed more under natural day length than in the dark and the
   northern population had higher consumption than the southern. The
   relative high growth of fish from the northern population in the dark
   compared to the southern populations was due partly to higher
   consumption and partly to higher growth efficiency. Fish from the
   southern populations had negative growth efficiency in the dark.
   3. We also studied the importance of ice cover under more hostile
   conditions in stream channels using the northern population only.
   Juveniles held in channels with simulated ice cover lost less energy (20
   J g(-1) day(-1)) than those held in channels with transparent cover (26
   J g(-1) day(-1)). This difference in energy loss was due partly (50\%)
   to higher food consumption under simulated ice (4.5 and 1.6 J g(-1),
   respectively) and partly (30\%) to light-induced differences in resting
   metabolic rate.
   4. In conclusion, both experiments showed lower metabolic costs in
   darkness under simulated ice cover than without ice. Under benign
   laboratory conditions the response to light (ice cover) varied among
   populations and only the northern population were able to attain
   positive growth in the dark. Under semi-natural conditions the lack of
   ice cover induced strong negative effects on the energy budget. Because
   energetic deficiencies are assumed to be an important cause of winter
   mortality, our study indicates that ice break-ups or removal following
   climatic change may affect winter survival significantly, particularly
   in northern populations.},

Abstract = {Seasonal occurrence of the parasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis
   (sea lice) was studied from March to December 2001 in two large north
   Norwegian sill fjords without fish farming activity, the Ranafjord and
   the Balsfjord. Anadromous brown trout Salmo trutta (sea trout) in both
   fjords had a low infestation rate during all sampling periods, but
   followed a seasonal pattern. During early and late winter (November to
   December and March to April) and spring (May to June), the prevalence
   varied from 0 to 25\% and the abundance was < 0.5 sea lice. Adults
   dominated (92\%) during this period, particularly gravid females. In
   both fjords, the highest prevalence was during September (80-81\%, all
   stages represented). In Ranafjord, the abundance and mean intensity
   during this month was 6.8 and 8.6 sea lice, respectively, while in
   Balsfjord it was 3.6 and 4.5 sea lice, respectively. Fish were captured
   at temperatures down to 1degreesC and at full strength sea water which
   is supposed to cause osmoregulatory problems for the fish. This
   observation has implications for the understanding of high-latitude sea
   trout behaviour and can also make the fish more vulnerable to heavy sea
   lice infestation during this period. It is suggested that winter running
   sea trout help to maintain a self replicating local population of sea
   lice within such fjord systems where other possible hosts (e.g. farmed
   Atlantic salmon Salmo salar) are not present during a whole year cycle.

Abstract = {Life histories are state-dependent, and an individual's reproductive
   decisions are determined by its available resources and the needs of its
   offspring. Here we test how a chick's needs for food and protection
   influence parental decisions in the Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica
   antarctica, where the parents, due to their long breeding lifespan, are
   expected to give priority to their own needs before those of the young.
   We exchanged one-day-old chicks with four-day-old chicks and studied how
   the parents subsequently provided care to the chick. The duration of the
   guarding period was adjusted, and parents left older chicks earlier and
   younger chicks later compared to controls. Three mechanisms were
   responsible for the adjustments. 1) Parents with an older chick
   co-ordinated fewer guarding spells whereas parents with a younger chick
   co-ordinated more guarding spells. 2) At the last guarding spell, i.e.
   where a parent left the chick alone before the partner returned, less
   time was spent with older chicks, and more time with younger chicks. 3)
   Foraging trip duration was shortened by parents given older chicks and
   prolonged by parents given younger chicks, probably in response to the
   chick's food demand. Hence, the parents responded quickly to the altered
   needs of the chick. Parents with high body mass guarded longer and were
   better able to co-ordinate the guarding spells compared to lighter
   parents. In conclusion, Antarctic petrels adjust reproductive decisions
   to their own, their mate's, and their chick's state, and they seem to
   respond to the chick's needs for both food and protection.},

Abstract = {Spatial patterns of important population or individual characteristics
   are expected to reflect structuring ecosystem processes to the extent
   that populations with strikingly different spatial patterns most likely
   have been structured by different processes. Few studies of spatial
   pattern in plant assemblages, bryophyte assemblages in particular, still
   exist and pattern has only vaguely been linked with process. In this
   study we describe fine-scale spatial variation in size and the
   occurrence of terminated (non-branching) segments in 21 Norwegian
   populations of the dominant boreal forest moss Hylocomium splendens, in
   search for general patterns of spatial structure.
   All Hylocomium splendens segments in the investigated plots were
   followed for a 10-year period; their size (dry mass, estimated from in
   situ measurements) and fate (terminated or ramifying) were recorded
   annually. The spatial structure of size and terminating segments at
   scales from 0.5 to 16 cm was described for each population as fractal
   dimension profiles, derived from semi-variograms. For about one half of
   the populations size and terminating segments could be assigned to a
   specific spatial pattern, the predicted outcome of one of three main
   structuring processes: (i) negative spatial dependence (fractal
   dimension F>3.0) on the scale of individuals (below 2 cm), indicative of
   negative interactions; (ii) positive spatial dependence (F<3.0) on the
   scale of individuals, indicative of positive interactions; and (iii)
   positive spatial dependence on broader (4-8 cm) scales, indicative of
   structuring by environmental factors or patchy disturbance. Patterns (i)
   and (iii) were observed both for size and terminated segments more often
   than expected. Fractal dimension profiles for size obtained separately
   for each year revealed temporal patterns of spatial structure that
   tended to be invariant over years. Negative spatial dependence of size,
   possibly due to large size difference between buried segments and other
   segments during self thinning, was typical of populations rapidly
   growing in number. Positive spatial dependence with a range of influence
   by the spatial process of 4-8 cm was observed in plots with sparse
   bryophyte cover and high cover of deciduous litter, probably due to
   accumulation of litter in depressions between shoots or groups of
   shoots. The main finding of this study is that different populations of
   the same species in the same type of ecosystem can be spatially
   structured in different ways. This accords with a model for the studied
   system as consisting of a mosaic of cells, of spatial extent of a few cm
   or larger, intergrading in space and temporally dynamic, the population
   characteristics of each cell being shaped by several structuring
   processes that vary, temporally and spatially, in their relative
   importance.},

Abstract = {Northern Botswana and adjacent areas, have the world's largest
   population of African elephant (Loxodonta africana). However, a 100
   years ago elephants were rare following excessive hunting.
   Simultaneously, ungulate populations were severely reduced by decease.
   The ecological effects of the reduction in large herbivores must have
   been substantial, but are little known. Today, however, ecosystem
   changes following the increase in elephant numbers cause considerable
   concern in Botswana. This was the background for the ``BONIC{''}
   project, investigating the interactions between the increasing elephant
   population and other ecosystem components and processes. Results confirm
   that the ecosystem is changing following the increase in elephant and
   ungulate populations, and, presumably, developing towards a situation
   resembling that before the reduction of large herbivores. We see no
   ecological reasons to artificially change elephant numbers. There are,
   however, economic and social reasons to control elephants, and their
   range in northern Botswana may have to be artificially restricted.},

Abstract = {The study focuses on vegetation changes in the Nordic mountain birch
   forest in northern Norway, covering a period of more than 40 yr. The
   study area comprises the municipalities of Kautokeino and Karasjok on
   Finnmarkskvidda; it is predominantly covered by lichen and dwarf shrub
   vegetation. Sizes of various vegetation classes were estimated by the
   use of remote-sensing techniques and ground surveys. A significant
   change in vegetation cover during the study period was registered in the
   whole study area. Vegetation types dominated by bilberry (Vaccinium
   myrtillus), wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia fleuxuosa), the dwarf cornel
   (Cornus suecica), and mosses have tripled in abundance compared to 40 yr
   ago. In contrast, lichen-dominated heaths and woodland (forests),
   preferred by the reindeer stocks intensively utilizing these areas of
   Finnmarksvidda, have decreased by approximately 80\% in abundance during
   the same period. Correspondingly, there has been a significant increase
   in the extent of birch forests especially in Kautokeino (90\% increase).
   The reason for the steep decline in lichen-dominated areas appears to be
   a direct consequence of the intensive grazing by the increasing reindeer
   population in the period 1961-1987, but climate change (increased
   precipitation), caterpillar attacks, and long-transported air pollution
   (e.g., nitrogen) may also have accentuated the increase of forests and
   other vegetation types.},

Abstract = {A survey on attitudes toward large carnivores was conducted in a
   representative sample of the Norwegian population (n = 3134). People
   were asked about the acceptability of carnivores living in remote
   wilderness, close to where people live, killing livestock, killing pets,
   or threatening humans. Large differences in acceptability appeared
   across the five situations. Wolves and bears were less acceptable than
   lynx and wolverines when observed close to where people live. Negative
   associations were found between acceptability and lack of personal
   control, economic loss, and respondents' age. Acceptability was higher
   among males than among females, and higher among urban than among rural
   residents. The results showed that general measures of attitudes alone
   toward large carnivores were of limited value in wildlife management.
   The situational and social specificity of these attitudes should be
   given more attention.},

Abstract = {We caught smolts of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus ( L.), Atlantic
   salmon, Salmo salar L., and brown trout, Salmo trutta L., in a trap
   situated at the mouth of the river Halselva (70degreesN 23degreesE),
   northern Norway during a 5-year period. Salmon and charr were the first
   to leave freshwater at the end of May, while most trout left freshwater
   about 14 days later. Whereas the midnight sun shines continuously during
   the downstream migration period, the light intensity has a diel
   intensity pattern. The majority of the descending migrants were recorded
   during the night. The number of descending fish was relatively low at
   water temperatures below 3degreesC. The increase in water level was
   largely caused by snowmelt and thus correlated with lower water
   temperatures. The number of migrants of all three species increased with
   increasing water level and decreased with increasing water temperature,
   with the exception of trout, which increased with water temperature.
   Notably, the increase in number of migrants was also correlated with the
   increase in water level the following day, indicating that fish
   movements represent an early response to a later spate. There was no
   significant relationship between the number of migrants and the daily
   change in water level or temperature. The three species were highly
   synchronised in their daily number of migrants. The strongest
   synchronisation was found between Arctic charr and Atlantic salmon,
   followed by Arctic charr and brown trout.},

Abstract = {Long-term mortality and movements of cichlids after catch-and-release
   angling in a subtropical warm river were studied by radio tagging 15
   nembwe (Serranochromis robustus) and 9 threespot tilapia (Oreochromis
   andersonii) in the Zambezi River in Africa. No direct mortality from
   catch- and-release angling was recorded, even though water temperatures
   were as high as 27-30 degreesC during capture. Indirect
   catch-and-release mortality could be increased risk of being predated
   upon before recovering from capture and release, as the transmitter from
   one threespot tilapia was found under a typical African fish eagle
   (Haliaeetus vocifer) tree, indicating that it was captured by a fish
   eagle. Excessive movements the first days after release compared to
   later in the season could indicate a behavioural reaction to capture and
   release. It is concluded that catch-and-release angling may be a
   successful management strategy to sustain recreational fisheries of
   cichlids in declining populations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Individual daily food intake, mass-specific growth rate and growth

   in tank experiments with three water level regimes (fluctuating, stable

   between 10 and 14degrees C and constant 14degrees C) to simulate events
   during hydropeaking in regulated rivers. Fish exposed to high stable
   water level showed higher food intake and growth rate, and higher or
   similar growth efficiency than fish exposed to fluctuating or stable low
   water level. Both groups of slow-growing and fast-growing individuals
   fed less and grew slower at stable low and fluctuating water level than
   at stable high water level. Furthermore, growth and growth efficiency
   were lower in brown trout exposed to stable low water level and
   fluctuating temperature, particularly for groups of fish with slow
   growth. Temperature did not have any effect at high water level. For
   groups of fast-growing fish, there was no difference in growth
   efficiency between treatments. It is concluded that fluctuating water
   level and temperature have a potentially detrimental effect on growth in
   juvenile brown trout and effects are more severe in slow- than
   fast-growing fish. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Abstract = {Question: Does the understorey vegetation of Norwegian boreal forests
   change in relation to broad-scale, long-term changes?
   Location: Norway.
   Methods: Permanently marked 1-m(2) vegetation plots from 17 monitoring
   reference areas in forests dominated by Picea abies (11 areas, 620
   plots) and Betula spp. (six areas, 300 plots) were analysed twice, at
   the start in 1988-1997 and 5 yr later (1993-2002). Species subplot
   frequency data were analysed separately for each area by univariate and
   multivariate statistical methods; 5-yr changes in single species
   abundances, species number per plot and species composition were tested.
   Results: Two distinct patterns of change were found: 1. Abundance of
   several vascular plant species decreased in SE Norwegian Picea forests.
   most noticeably of species with a preference for richer soils, such as
   Oxalis acetosella. 2. Abundance of many bryophyte species as well as
   bryophyte species number per plot increased in forests of both types
   over most of Norway.
   Conclusions: The pattern of vascular plant changes is probably a
   time-delayed response of long-lived, mainly clonal, populations to
   acidified soils resulting from deposition of long-distance airborne
   pollutants. The pattern bryophyte changes. with reference to the close
   link between climatic conditions for growth and abundance changes for
   Hylocomium splendens established in previous demographic studies, is
   related to climatic conditions favourable for bryophyte growth. We
   conclude that many forest understorey plants are sensitive indicators of
   environmental change, and that the concept used for intensive monitoring
   of Norwegian forests enables early detection of changes in vegetation
   brought about by broad-scale, regional, impact factors.},

Abstract = {We compiled the data on the insect assemblage occurring within the
   polypore Fomitopsis pinicola from six regions in Finland, Sweden and
   Norway. The species composition and diversity of the primary fungivorous
   beetles (Cisidae and Anobidae) were similar across Fennoscandia. The
   beetles Cis glabratus Mellie (Cisidae) and C. quadridens Mellie were the
   most frequent species occurring in 70\% and 23\% of the fruiting bodies
   on average. Sulcacis fronticornis (Panzer) and Ennearthron cornutum
   (Gyllenhal) were relatively common in southern Sweden, while absent from
   the study regions in Norway and Finland. Similarly, Cis bidentatus
   (Olivier) and Cis dentatus Mellie were rather common in Norway, but
   almost absent from the Finnish samples. Species relative abundances in
   the six study regions exhibit more variation, which to some extent
   corresponds the biogeographical zones. Our results on the high
   similarity in species composition indicate deterministic nature of the
   F. pinicola-associated insect assemblage over large spatial scales. On
   the other hand, climatic factors probably have an impact on the relative
   abundance of species.},

Title = {Sex differences in the interplay of cohort and mother quality on body
   mass of red deer calves},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {85},
Number = {7},

Abstract = {We investigated the role of individual variation among female red deer
   (Cervus elaphus) on the body mass of their offspring based on the
   long-term monitoring (1977-1996) of a Norwegian population. We studied
   273 calves weighed in winter, belonging to 114 mothers of known age.
   After accounting for yearly variation, we found that calf body mass
   increased with the age of their mother until mothers were 6 years of
   age, then leveled off until 15 years of age. Body mass varied from year
   to year in similar ways for male and female calves. Winter harshness,
   and density when calves were in utero, could account for only a small
   part of this variation. Variation in calf body mass could be decomposed
   into a climatic component, determining the mean body mass of a cohort,
   and a mother component, determining the position of calves' body mass
   relative to the mean of their cohort. The mother effect could be further
   decomposed into an effect of the mother's age and an effect of the
   mother's quality. The latter explained >35\% of the body mass variation
   in male calves, and similar to15\% in females, while the proportions of
   the variation due to cohort effect were 28\% and 42\%, respectively. The
   mother's quality effect was therefore sex-specific and accounted for
   similar to1.5 times more of the variance in male than female body mass.
   Females with relatively long jawbones for their age had larger calves.
   We supported the hypothesis that female's quality influences the quality
   of her offspring and that this effect lingered until after the end of
   the weaning period. Our results suggest that the variance in
   reproductive success among females is certainly larger than previously
   thought in red deer.},

Title = {Timing and duration of moult in three populations of Purple Sandpipers

Abstract = {Timing and duration of primary moult in three populations of Purple
   Sandpipers Calidris maritima were described and discussed in relation to
   the birds' need to complete moult before the onset of winter, when
   resources are required for survival. We predicted that moult would be
   completed earlier by birds wintering at higher latitudes. The south
   Norwegian breeding population, which moults and winters along the coast
   of east Britain (54-57degreesN) had a mean starting date of 21 July for
   primary moult (16 July for females and 24 July for males), a mean
   duration of 61 days, and completed on 20 September. Resident Icelandic
   (64-65degreesN) birds had a mean starting date of 22 July for primary
   moult (17 July for females and 25 July for males), a mean duration of 51
   days, and completed on 11 September. Birds moulting in north Norway
   (70degreesN) arrived in north Norway in suspended primary moult or
   without having started moult, and completed it there. They had a mean
   completion date of 2 November for primary moult (31 October for females
   and 3 November for males). Starting date and duration could not be
   estimated because some suspended moult for an undetermined period, but
   it was thought that they started in late August. It is likely that most
   originated from Russia. The onset of moult appears to be set by the end
   of breeding and there is little overlap in these two events. The earlier
   start of moult by females in all three populations may be because they
   abandon the males when the chicks hatch, leaving the males to attend the
   chicks. Although the duration of primary moult followed the expected
   trend, being fastest in north Norway and slowest in Britain, the onset
   of moult was so late in north Norway that they had an unexpectedly late
   completion date, despite their rapid moult. The late completion of
   primary moult in north Norway suggests that wintering in the far north
   may not pose the energetic constraints on Purple Sandpipers that had
   previously been supposed.},

Abstract = {As the most widespread seagrass in temperate waters of the Northern
   Hemisphere, Zostera marina provides a unique opportunity to investigate
   the extent to which the historical legacy of the last glacial maximum
   (LGM18000-10000 years BP) is detectable in modern population genetic
   structure. We used sequences from the nuclear rDNA-internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS) and chloroplast matK-intron, and nine microsatellite loci
   to survey 49 populations (> 2000 individuals) from throughout the
   species' range. Minimal sequence variation between Pacific and Atlantic
   populations combined with biogeographical groupings derived from the
   microsatellite data, suggest that the trans-Arctic connection is
   currently open. The east Pacific and west Atlantic are more connected
   than either is to the east Atlantic. Allelic richness was almost
   two-fold higher in the Pacific. Populations from putative Atlantic
   refugia now represent the southern edges of the distribution and are not
   genetically diverse. Unexpectedly, the highest allelic diversity was
   observed in the North Sea-Wadden Sea-southwest Baltic region. Except for
   the Mediterranean and Black Seas, significant isolation-by-distance was
   found from similar to150 to 5000 km. A transition from weak to strong
   isolation-by-distance occurred at similar to150 km among northern
   European populations suggesting this scale as the natural limit for
   dispersal within the metapopulation. Links between historical and
   contemporary processes are discussed in terms of the projected effects
   of climate change on coastal marine plants. The identification of a high
   genetic diversity hotspot in Northern Europe provides a basis for
   restoration decisions.},

Abstract = {The fish species vendace (Coregonus albula) invaded the sub-arctic
   Pasvik watercourse during the second half of the 1980s, and became the
   dominant pelagic species in the upstream part of the watercourse within
   a few years. Life history traits of the pioneer population of vendace in
   Pasvik were recorded from 1991-2000. A rapid increase in population
   density in the upstream part of the watercourse was accompanied by
   decreased growth rates, decreased fecundity and a reduced size at first
   maturation. The downstream part of the watercourse showed a similar, but
   delayed, change in life history traits compared to the upstream part.
   The study documents great life history variability of a non-native fish
   species entering a new environment. We discuss two co-acting
   explanations for the observed patterns: (i) a density dependent response
   mediated by food depletion; and (ii) a pioneer strategy that allocates
   resources to favour reproduction at early developmental stages with a
   high number of offspring, trading off growth and size of offspring.},

Abstract = {The impacts of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure on smoltification
   and subsequent seawater performance were investigated in
   hatchery-reared, anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). The fish
   were subjected to a 2-month summer seawater residence, after which they
   were orally dosed with 0 (Control, C), 1 (Low Dose, LD) or 100 mg
   Aroclor 1254 kg(-1) body mass (High Dose, HD) in November. They were
   then held in fresh water, without being fed (to mimic their natural
   overwintering in freshwater), until they had smolted in June the next
   year. The smolts were then transferred to seawater and fed to mimic
   their summer feeding residence in seawater, followed by a period without
   food in freshwater from August until maturation in October. Compared
   with C and LD charr, the HD charr had either a transient or a permanent
   reduction in plasma growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, and
   thyroxin and triiodothyronine titers during the period of
   smoltification. These hormonal alterations in the HD chaff corresponded
   with impaired hyposmoregulatory ability in May and June, as well as
   reduced growth rate and survival after transference to seawater.
   Consequently, fewer fish in the HD group matured in October compared to
   the other two treatments. The HD fish had a liver PCB concentration
   ranging between 14 and 42 mg kg(-1) wet mass, whereas there were
   similar, and very low, liver PCB concentrations in LD and C fish
   throughout the smolting period. Our findings suggest that PCB might
   compromise mechanisms important for fitness in a fish species living in
   an extreme environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The southern Norwegian wolverine (Gulo gulo) population was considered
   functionally extinct in the 1960s but has partly recovered in recent
   years. Proper management of this population is highly dependent on
   reliable estimates of critical population parameters such as population
   size, sex ratio, immigration rate, and reproductive contribution from
   immigrants. We report on a large-scale population monitoring project
   assessing these parameters through genetic tagging of individuals, with
   feces as the source of DNA. Sixty-eight different individuals were
   detected among 147 successfully genotyped samples collected in 2000 and
   2001. Sixty of these individuals were represented in the 2001 sample,
   which may be considered a minimum estimate of the population size.
   Almost 50\% of these animals were sampled only once, however, indicating
   that the true population size may be markedly higher. Accordingly, a
   capture-recapture estimate based on the observed resampling rates
   suggested a population size of 89 wolverines (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] = 74-104), which is approximately 35\% higher than an estimate of
   64 obtained from the number of active natal dens (95\% CI = 46-95; p =
   0.08). Indirect estimates of dispersal distances inferred from
   mother-offspring relationships suggested that wolverine males have the
   ability to disperse up to 500 km, a distance exceeding anything
   previously reported in the literature. Dispersal distances of more than
   100 km were detected for females. Bayesian clustering analysis and
   subsequent assessment of individual relationships suggest that
   immigrants from northern Scandinavia have contributed and still
   contribute to the southern Norwegian gene pool, counteracting genetic
   erosion and reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. Additional
   sampling efforts will be undertaken during the coming years to allow for
   observations of population trends, immigration rate, and reproductive
   variance among individuals. Such data will provide an important basis
   for the design of an appropriate conservation plan for this small and
   vulnerable population.},

Abstract = {Non-invasive genetic analyses are important for studies of species that
   are rare, sensitive or at risk of extinction. This study investigates
   the possibility of using faeces and urine to obtain microsatellite
   genotypes for individual identification of wolverines (Gulo gulo). The
   reliability of the employed method was assessed by analysing independent
   amplifications of non-invasive samples (a multiple-tube approach) and by
   comparing genotypes obtained from faeces to genotypes obtained from
   blood or tissue of the same individual. Ten microsatellite markers were
   successfully amplified in 65\% of the faecal samples (n = 32) and 40\%
   of the urine samples (n = 22). Allelic dropout was found in 12 and 14\%
   of the amplifications from extracts of faeces and urine, respectively.
   Nevertheless, all multi-locus genotypes were correct, as judged from
   comparison to data from tissue or blood samples, after three replicates.
   These results suggest that a non-invasive approach based on DNA-analysis
   of faeces can be a powerful tool in population monitoring of wolverines,
   potentially providing reliable estimates of population size and
   immigration rate. A second objective of the study was to develop markers
   for DNA-based sex identification in wolverines using non-invasive
   samples. We developed two Y-linked markers, one that was specific to
   wolverine and one that also successfully identified sex in another
   mustelid. Importantly, none of the markers amplified potential prey
   species such as reindeer or rodents.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the impact of man's interventions on
   the present day distribution of fish in a mountain area in southern
   Norway, the Atna river system. River Atna originates in the Rondane
   mountains at altitudes of nearly 1600 m a.s.l., and joins River Glomma
   at 300 m a.s.l. There are 98 lakes in the watercourse (701-1565 m
   a.s.l.). Lake Atnsjoen is the largest lake (5.0 km(2)). Data on the
   occurrence, origin and status of fish in lakes were obtained by means of
   interviews, questionnaires and written sources. Occurrence in rivers and
   streams was surveyed by electrofishing. While the lower reaches of River
   Glomma contain most of the freshwater fish species found in Norway, the
   Atna watercourse has a poor fish fauna. Physical conditions, e. g. steep
   river gradients and several impassable waterfalls have prevented fish
   from reaching most lakes and river stretches after the deglaciation some
   6000 years ago. Five species of fish are regarded as native to the area;
   brown trout (Salmo trutta), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), grayling
   (Thymallus thymallus), Siberian sculpin (Cottus poecilopus) and European
   minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus). Although only native species are found in
   the area, the present distribution of these species within the
   watercourse is to a very large extent a result of human interventions
   during the past 100-130 years. Brown trout were originally found in the
   main branch of the river, including Lake Atnsjoen and a few small lakes
   (n < 5) further upstream, but it is now found in 65 lakes. Arctic charr
   were native only to Lake Atnsjoen, but now inhabit 20 lakes. Grayling
   remains restricted to River Atna below the waterfall at the outlet of
   Lake Atnsjoen. The natural distribution of Siberian sculpin is
   restricted to the main river below Liafossen waterfall (14 km above Lake
   Atnsjoen). During the 1890s, this species was accidentally introduced to
   Lake Setningsjoen, and subsequently spread to another three lakes
   further upstream. The European minnow was native only to the River Atna
   below Lake Atnsjoen, but was accidentally introduced to seven lakes in
   the course of this century. There are 24 fishless lakes in the
   watershed, mainly mountain lakes between 1033 and 1587 m a.s.l.},

Abstract = {River Atna is situated in south-eastern Norway and stretches from
   approx. 1400 m a.s.l. in the Rondane Mountains, through Lake Atnsjoen,
   at 701 m a.s.l.; to the confluence with River Glomma at 338 m a.s.l. The
   catchment area is 1323 km(2), oligotrophic and very susceptible to acid
   precipitation. The river water is very poor in nutrients and ions, and
   pH varies from 5.0 to 7.2. Samples were taken each year from 1987 to
   2002 at three to five localities from 1280 to 380 m a.s.l. Insect larvae
   were collected by Surber sampling and by kick sampling. Malaise traps
   were used to collect adults of Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Chironomidae and
   Limoniidae. A total of 16 taxa of Ephemeroptera, 24 taxa of Plecoptera,
   39 taxa of Trichoptera, 125 taxa of Chironomidae and 52 taxa of
   Limoniidae, were identified. Our results from Atna provide some support
   for a zonation of the river based on zoobenthos. The occurrence and
   abundance of functional groups among the Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and
   Chironomidae are discussed in relation to the River Continuum Concept
   (RCC). Our conclusion is that grazers dominate in the zoobenthos in
   streams in the treeless alpine region in Norway. Natural lakes, which
   occur in most watercourses in Norway, appear to cause a disturbance in
   relation to the original RCC concept, as the zoobenthos community in and
   below the lake outlet is dominated by collectors ( filter feeders). The
   pattern found in the Atna watercourse is probably a general pattern for
   a northern watercourse in the Holarctic, where the glacial periods
   created lakes in most watercourses. The results of the long term
   sampling in Atna are discussed in relation to the practicalities and the
   cost-benefit of zoobenthos in efficient bio-monitoring in rivers.},

Abstract = {Age, growth and density of Siberian sculpin (Cottus poecilopus) and
   young brown trout (Salmo trutta) within two sections of River Atna;
   above Lake Atnsjoen {[}Section 1 at altitudes between 739 and 715 m] and
   below Lake Atnsjoen {[}Section 2 at altitudes between 430 and 370 m] was
   studied during a 6-year period (1986-91). The water temperature was
   considerably lower in Section 1 than in Section 2, as the number of days
   with a water temperature above 10degreesC (T-Dgreater than or equal
   to10degreesC) from spring to August 1 ranged between 2-26 and 26-52
   days, respectively. Juvenile brown trout (age 0+) attained a
   significantly smaller body size in Section 1 than in Section 2; mean
   length +/-SD was 35 +/- 8 mm (ranged 27-46) and 43 +/- 7 mm (range
   38-46), respectively. In Section 2, there was a highly positive
   correlation between the body length of 0+ brown trout and mean water
   temperature in June (p < 0.005), and also to some extent in Section 1 (p
   = 0.11). Individuals of age 1+ did not exhibit any such difference,
   while fish in age group 2+ were larger in Section 1 than in Section 2.
   By using the number of days with a water temperature between the range
   5-10\&DEG;C (TD\&GE;5-10\&DEG;C) as test variables, we found a highly
   positive correlation between the August 1 body length of 0+ brown trout
   and T-D\&GE;9 \&DEG;C from spring to August 1 in Section 2 (p < 0.05),
   as opposed to T-Dgreater than or equal to7 degreesC for trout in Section
   1 (p = 0.11). Young Siberian sculpin (age 0+ and 1+) also exhibited
   slower growth in Section 1 than in Section 2, but this was not the case
   among older specimens. In the year with the lowest temperature measured
   ( 1987), no 0+ Siberian sculpin were caught in any of the two sections,
   indicating that low temperature affects their survival. Both species
   exhibited large spatial and temporal variation in density. Thus, data on
   abundance and growth sampled on one occasion at one site can not be
   regarded as representative for these two fish populations.},

Abstract = {The density, diet and habitat use of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and
   Siberian sculpin (Cottus poecilopus) were studied in the subalpine River
   Atna in southeastern Norway in the autumn during a six year period
   (1986-1991). There was an inverse relationship between the density of
   brown trout and Siberian sculpin. Diet overlap, as indicated by the
   Schoener index, was high between the two species, ranging between 0.48
   and 0.86. Chironomid larvae and other aquatic insects were the most
   common food items for both species. Brown trout also consumed
   substantive amounts of surface insects. Siberian sculpin typically
   occupied sites with finer substrates and greater water depths than brown
   trout, even though there was considerable overlap in habitat use between
   the two species. Because the two species shared similar habitats, we
   suggest that the potential for species interactions exists, particularly
   at sites where density of sculpin is high.},

Abstract = {Quantitative samples were collected from Lake Atnsjoen five times per
   year in the growth seasons 1990-2000. The samples were analysed for
   variation in the phytoplankton composition, and the total volume and
   volume of the main groups of algae were calculated. Lake Atnsjoen is a
   large, deep and unregulated lake with a surface area of 4.8 km(2) and a
   maximum depth of 80.2 m. It is a nutrient-poor, oligotrophic lake with a
   maximum phytoplankton volume varying between 125-393 mm(3)/m(3) in the
   years 1990-2000. The phytoplankton community is dominated by species of
   the groups Chrysophyceae and Cryptophyceae. The chrysophytes dominate
   the phytoplankton in the early part of the growth season (May-June)
   while the cryptophytes increase throughout the season and dominate in
   the autumn. Among the chrysophytes different species of chrysomonads
   were most frequent together with common species of the genus Dinobryon
   like D. borgei, D. cylindricum var. alpinum and D. crenulatum. A total
   of 22 species or taxa of chrysophytes were recorded in the samples.
   Common among the cryptomonads were several species of the genus
   Cryptomonas. Most important quantitatively, however, were Rhodomonas
   lacustris and Katablepharis ovalis. The succesion of the phytoplankton
   throughout the growth season was similar from year to year in
   quantitative as well as qualitative terms, but some changes were
   recorded after the great flood in 1995. Canonical Correspondence
   Analysis (CCA) shows a slight, but significant, phytoplankton community
   change over the succeeding years.},

Title = {Zooplankton in Lake Atnsjoen 1985-1997},

Volume = {521},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {149-175},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study long-term changes in the zooplankton
   of a subalpine locality unaffected by direct anthropogenic disturbances.
   The material has been collected during the period 1985-1997; since 1988
   a standardised sampling program has been followed, with five sampling
   dates during the ice free period (June-October) at three fixed stations.
   Altogether 17 species of Rotatoria, 9 species of Copepoda and 11 species
   of Cladocera were recorded. Of these 10 species of Rotatoria, two
   species of Copepoda and five species of Cladocera occur regularly in the
   plankton. Polyarthra vulgaris dominate among the rotifers together with
   Kellicottia longispina and Conochilus unicornis. The crustacean
   community is dominated by the copepod Cyclops scutifer, and the
   cladocerans Bosmina longispina, Holopedium gibberum and Daphnia
   longispina. The cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus, Polyphemus
   pediculus, and the copepods Arctodiaptomus laticeps and Heterocope
   saliens all occur regularly, but at low densities. The zooplankton
   density is low in May/June and peaks in August and September, but the
   timing of maximum densities varies from year to year. By numbers, the
   rotifers strongly dominate with densities 10-15 times higher than the
   crustaceans. The annual maximum density (rotifers plus crustaceans)
   ranged from 50 ind. l(-1) (1985, 1988) to 450 ind. l(-1) (1995). Mean
   density is about 140-150 ind. l(-1). By biomass (dry weight), the
   cladocerans constitute 60\%, while the copepods and rotifers constitute
   30\% and 10\% of the zooplankton, respectively. The annual maximum has
   varied between 70 and 260 mug dw l(-1), with 170 mug dw l(-1) as the
   mean level. C. scutifer usually has a one-year lifecycle without
   diapause, but a small fraction of the population has a two-year
   lifecycle. The life cycle in 1989 and 1990 differed strongly from the
   other years. The life cycles of B. longispina, D. longispina and
   possibly also H. gibberum and A. laticeps, indicate two generations
   during the summer. H. gibberum and H. saliens pass the winter as resting
   eggs. The other crustacean species, except C. scutifer, pass the winter
   mainly as resting eggs, but all have a small winter population in the
   water mass. C. scutifer is the only species without resting eggs. The
   vertical distribution normally shows highest density between 5 and 10 m
   depth. However, during some periods maximum density is observed close to
   the surface, while at other times it is seen deep in the hypolimnion.
   The vertical distribution is most pronounced when the thermocline is
   sharp, and less pronounced during the full circulation in autumn. The
   vertical migration may also be pronounced, especially in B. longispina,
   with high density near the surface during the night. The vertical
   migration is less pronounced among the rotifers and copepods. The degree
   of vertical migration varies with temperature and food conditions. There
   is little variation from year to year in species composition, but large
   variation in species dominance, seasonal development, population
   density, and vertical and horizontal distribution during the sampling
   period. Variations in temperature, food condition, predation, and water
   through-flow are possible causes for the observed differences between
   the years. Input of allochthonous material is especially important.
   However, no clear correlation have been found between the development of
   the plankton community and these environmental factors. Hence, these
   interactions are complex and multifactorial.},

Abstract = {The annual variability in growth and life history traits of brown trout
   (Salmo trutta L.) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus ( L.)) in Lake
   Atnsjoen, a Norwegian subalpine lake, was studied over a period of 13
   years (1985-1997). The extent to which life-history characteristics
   recorded on one occasion can be regarded as representative for the
   population was explored. We found inter-cohort variation in growth for
   both species; estimates of asymptotic length (L-infinity) in ten cohorts
   ranged between 225-305 mm (CV = 10.5\%) for brown trout and 273-301 mm
   (CV = 4.1\%) for Arctic charr. However, this variation was much lower
   than inter-population variation for brown trout based on single samples
   from 169 populations (CV = 24.6\%). In Lake Atnsjoen, annual growth
   increment correlated highly with the number of days warmer than 7
   degreesC (R-2 = 0.60-0.89) for brown trout, and days warmer than 10
   degreesC (R-2 = 0.40-0.58) for Arctic charr. Females of Arctic charr
   were younger at sexual maturity than males, while no such difference was
   found in brown trout. Generally speaking, early maturing individuals of
   both species grew faster, particularly from age-2 and onwards, than
   immature individuals. Early maturing individuals, however, were smaller
   at maturity than those maturing one year older. Age and size at maturity
   were significantly correlated with asymptotic lengths only in Arctic
   charr females.},

Abstract = {We studied the spatial and temporal variation in relative abundance
   (CPUE), habitat use, and diet of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.))
   and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in Lake Atnsjoen in southern Norway
   over a period of 14 years (1985-1998). Fish were sampled with gill nets
   in epibenthic and pelagic habitats in August each year. Stratified
   sampling in the epibenthic habitat was carried out with gill net series
   at three depth zones (0-10, 10-30 and 30-70 m) at one station
   (1985-1993), and at seven depth zones between 0-3 m and 50-70 m at 10
   different stations with multi-mesh gill nets (1994-1998). Lake Atnsjoen
   is a relatively deep ( maximum 80 m), unregulated, subalpine,
   oligotrophic lake which is not affected to any extent by local or
   long-range pollution. In shallow epibenthic areas, brown trout is the
   most abundant species, while Arctic charr dominate deeper epibenthic
   areas. Epibenthic catches of brown trout at 0-10 m depth were inversely
   correlated with the catches of Arctic charr. The catches of epibenthic
   brown trout and Arctic charr did not correlate with mean water
   temperature in the sampling period. In the pelagic zone, brown trout
   were mainly caught close to the surface (0-6 m), while Arctic charr were
   caught between the surface and 12 m depth. Pelagic fish of both species
   were significantly larger than individuals caught in the epibenthic
   habitat. The mean size of epibenthic brown trout increased with depth.
   The opposite trend was evident for Arctic charr, although some larger
   fish also occupy deeper areas. The size of brown trout in epibenthic
   areas correlated inversely with CPUE, while no such relationship existed
   for Arctic charr. The most important food items for Arctic charr in both
   habitats in August were various species of zooplankton; Daphnia
   longispina, Bosmina longispina, Bythotrephes longimanus and Polyphemus
   pediculus. Brown trout mainly foraged near the surface on insects in
   both habitats, but B. longimanus and P. pediculus were preyed upon to
   some extent by pelagic specimens. The number of piscivorous individuals
   was low in both species (1.9-4.5\%).},

   fresh water (FW). The ventral aorta of each fish was fitted with a
   Doppler cuff in order to measure cardiac output, stroke volume and heart
   rate during swim testing. Blood samples were taken at rest and after
   exercise. Critical swimming speed of infected fish in SW (2(.)14 +/-

   Cardiac and blood results indicated infected fish exposed to FW did
   experience stress, but relief from osmotic and ionic distress probably
   reduces energy expenditure, allowing the increase in performance. As the
   performance of sea lice-infected Fish improved upon transfer to FW, it
   is likely that heavily infected salmonids do return to FW to restore
   compromised osmotic and ionic balance, and remove sea lice in the
   process. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Abstract = {Stomach content analyses were conducted on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
   post-smolt (average size, 119-154mm fork length, L-F) caught in eight
   large Norwegian fjord systems along a north-south geographical axis
   during 1998-2001. In general, post-smolts from southern Norway showed
   low feeding intensity in the fjords, whereas extensive feeding was
   observed in fjords in the northern and middle parts of Norway. The
   marine diet mainly included different crustaceans and in particular
   marine pelagic fish larvae (sand-eels Ammodytes spp., herring Clupea
   harengus and gadoids), but with a substantial spatial and annual
   variation in prey diversity and feeding intensity. Insects were most
   frequently taken in the estuary, although fishes often made a large
   contribution in mass. In contrast, fishes, and to some extent various
   crustaceans (particularly Hyperiidae, Gammaridae, Euphausiacea and
   Copepoda) dominated the diet in the middle and outer parts of the
   fjords, where post-smolts also fed more extensively than in the inner
   part. The results indicate that extensive feeding immediately after sea
   entrance may be more common for post-smolts in the northern and middle
   parts of Norway, than in the southern fjords. The observed differences
   in post-smolt feeding may be due to spatial and temporal differences in
   prey availability within and between the different types of fjord
   systems, and this might influence post-smolt growth and survival. (C)

Abstract = {Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) diet was Studied during three
   years (2001-2003) in an area where Arctic Kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) is
   extensively distributed off the central Norwegian coast. A total of 608
   diet samples, 378 (62.2\%) chick regurgitations, 22 (3.6\%) whole fish,
   and 208 (34.2\%) pellets were collected from the colonies at regular
   intervals during the chick-rearing period. From these samples a total of
   1,013 food items (after pairing the otoliths) were isolated,
   representing 18 fish species. Gadoids, mainly Cod (Gadus morhua) and
   Saithe (Pollachius virens) dominated the diet (75\% numerically, 86\% by
   biomass). During the first year of the Study, Cod represented nearly
   50\% of the diet, but decreased to 13\% in 2003. At the same time, the
   occurrence of Saithe in the diet increased from 23\% to 65\%. For Saithe
   age II-group fish dominated the diet in 2001, and I- and II- group
   dominated in 2002 and 2003. For Cod 0-group fish dominated the diet in
   2001 and 0- and I-group fish dominated in 2002 and 2003. The decrease in
   Cod in the diet of the Great Cormorant most probably reflected the
   decrease in the Norwegian coastal Cod population, and that the increase
   in Saithe in the diet is related to the relative increase in the
   abundance of this fish prey as the abundance of Cod decreased.},

Abstract = {Immune defences are undoubtedly of great benefit to the host, reducing
   the impact of infectious organisms. However, mounting immune responses
   also entails costs, which may be measured by inducing immune responses
   against artificial infections. We injected common eider (Somateria
   mollissima) females with three different non-pathogenic antigens, sheep
   red blood cells (SRBC), diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid, early in
   their incubation period. In the group of females that mounted a humoral
   immune response against SRBC, the return rate was only 27\%, whereas the
   group of females that did not mount a response against SRBC had a return
   rate of 72\%. Moreover, responding against diphtheria toxoid when also
   responding against SRBC led to a further reduction in return rate. These
   results are repeatable, as the same effect occurred independently in two
   study years. The severely reduced return rate of females producing
   antibodies against SRBC and diphtheria toxoid implies that these birds
   experienced considerably impaired long-term survival. This study thus
   documents severe costs of mounting humoral immune responses in a
   vertebrate. Such costs may explain why many organisms suppress immunity
   when under stress or when malnourished, and why infections may sometimes
   be tolerated without eliciting immune responses.},

Abstract = {Hamilton and Brown suggested that bright autumn coloration in trees is
   an energetically expensive and therefore honest (handicap) signal of
   defensive commitment against insects. If this is so, one should expect
   that the intensity of the proposed signal should depend strongly on tree
   health. However, to the best of our knowledge, the link between vigour
   and autumn colour has never been tested. We explored the relationship
   between autumn coloration and tree condition (i.e. leaf fluctuating
   asymmetry) in mountain birch (Betula pubescens). Our results indicate
   that bright autumn birches are in better condition and therefore
   consequently should be better at combating herbivores.},

Abstract = {Iteroparous mothers often face a trade-off between further investments
   in current offspring at the expense of the start of the next
   reproductive cycle. In the strongly seasonal environments at northern
   latitudes, large herbivores are typically calving in early summer each
   year to get a long growth season and to hit peak protein levels of
   vegetation. Late-born offspring are more likely to die since they are
   smaller in autumn. Low female condition in autumn due to prolonged
   investment in current-year offspring may lower her ability to ovulate
   sufficiently early to get a good start for the calves the following
   spring. On the basis of autopsies of uteri from 10,073 red deer (Cervus
   elaphus), we show that ovulation was delayed as well as more synchronous
   with increasing population density. This suggests that ovulation beyond
   a certain date incurs some fitness costs. Ovulation occurs progressively
   earlier with increasing age up to around 13 yr of age, after which
   ovulation again occurs later. Low ovulation rates in young compared with
   prime-aged deer were correlated with late ovulation in the fall. Also,
   yearling groups with a low rate of ovulation ( e. g., because of low
   weight) also ovulated later, and old senescent deer not calving the
   previous year ovulated less frequently and markedly later than those
   raising a calf. Our findings suggest, therefore, that mothers unable to
   ovulate before a certain date fail to do so altogether that year.},

Volume = {7},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Timing of breeding is a key factor determining the reproductive success
   in bird populations and known to be affected by climate fluctuations. We
   investigated the long-term (1978-2002) relationship between climate and
   hatching date within a population of Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica
   at Rost in the Norwegian Sea. The timing of puffin breeding was found to
   be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index (NAO). We
   isolated two temporal regimes, one where NAO had a significant effect on
   hatching date (1978-1986 and 1995-2002) and one where these variables
   were independent (1987-1994). Hatching date could be modelled using, in
   addition to NAO, hatching date and food abundance in the preceding
   breeding season (possibly proxies of parental effort). The models
   remained significant for regime 1 but not for regime 2. NAO differed
   between the two regimes suggesting that the shifts were induced by
   climate change, possibly via its effect on the availability of prey in
   the preceding year. The novelty of our study is the identification of
   temporal regimes in the effects of climate within one population.},

Abstract = {Fifty-three one-sea-winter Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (45-63 cm L-T)
   were radio-tagged in the Tana fjord, Barents Sea, in 1995. Thirty-seven
   fish (70\%) entered the freshwater zone of the River Tana in an average
   of 3 days after release in the fjord. The migration speeds in the lowest
   river section below the first riffle area were significantly higher than
   in the subsequent river section below the second riffle area. Similarly,
   the observed time spent in the first riffle area was significantly lower
   than in the next riffle area. The majority of Atlantic salmon entered
   the river during the hours of high tide and the subsequent ebb tide. In
   addition, most river entries were recorded around midnight. No effects
   of river flow on the river entry or migration speed were detected, but
   the migration speed of Atlantic salmon in both river sections examined
   was greater at lower temperatures. Twenly-eight fish (72\%) were
   recaptured in the river, 71\% of them with weirs and gillnets, and 29\%
   by rod and line. Over half of the Atlantic salmon (54\%) were recaptured
   within 3 weeks following river entry, and within the first 100 kin of
   the river (56\%). The results are discussed in relation to earlier
   studies oil multi-sea-winter Atlantic salmon in the River Tana. (C) 2004

Abstract = {Increased shoot growth has recurrently been recorded following real or
   simulated shoot browsing, although responses may vary between different
   woody species. We investigated morphological responses to simulated
   dry-season browsing on Colophospermum mopane, Acacia tortilis, Greivia
   flava, Peltophorum africanum and Ziziphus mucronata, which differ in
   growth rate occurrence of spines and use by mammalian herbivores.
   Treatment groups included it control. four clipping intensities and
   cutting at ground level. Responses were monitored during the following
   growth season on three annual shoots. located in the bottom, middle and
   top height. interval, on each sapling. All live species showed
   compensatory growth responses, although no obvious relation was found
   between the strength of responses and growth rate or natural browsing
   pressure. The general pattern was an increased shoot length, shoot
   diameter, number of lateral shoots and shoot biomass with increased
   clipping intensity. These responses are probably an effect of the
   reduction of competing growing points and disrupted apical dominance.
   Growth responses were stronger in shoots with higher location on the
   sapling, which may reflect. the pressure on saplings to attain a certain
   height to avoid browsing. reproduce and increase resistance to fire. We
   found no evidence of the number of spines being an induced defence in
   either of the two spinescent species studied.},

Abstract = {In eight mesocosms (land based basins) macroalgae communities with
   associated fauna were transplanted from the sea and established during
   two years. Then, different doses of nutrients (N and P) were added to
   the basins throughout the following three years. During the period of
   nutrient addition, macroinvertebrate grazers showed seasonal
   fluctuations with densities usually between 500,000 and I million
   individuals per mesocosm during summer and to a level of about 100,000
   during, winter. The macroinvertebrate grazers mainly consisted of about
   10 species of amphipods and isopods. among which the amphipod Gammarus
   locusta dominated strongly by biomass. Although the number of predators
   was very low. the grazer populations never reached a density where
   considerable grazing impact could be found on the macroalgae. No
   increase in grazer density was found in the basins with improved
   nutrient conditions. Thus food quality may be insufficient for further
   population growth, or density dependant regulation mechanisms may have
   prevented the grazers from flourishing, and overgrazing the system. In
   aquarium experiments we showed that G. locusta Could grow and reproduce
   on Fucus serratus. Ulva lactuca, periphyton and detritus, and that
   cannibalism by adult G. locusta on Juveniles may have great impact on
   the population growth. The basins were run with a water flow through
   system. Nets were placed in front of the inflow and Outflow tubes to
   measure immigration and emigration. Only few individuals (and no
   Gammarus sp.) were recorded in the inflowing water, while high numbers
   of both amphipods and isopods were found in the outflowing water.
   Emigration reached peak values during night-time. and it was then two to
   three times as high as during day-time. Emigration of mobile grazers
   from the basins amounted to 1-2\% of the standing stock daily. These
   mechanisms that regulate grazers do contribute to maintenance of the
   seaweed dominance and thus the stability of the seaweed community.},

Abstract = {Heritage conservation and management of landscapes is evident in many
   recent European policies and national reports on the state of the
   environment. To assist in the management of heritage resources, we
   present a landscape approach to the identification of localities with a
   high probability of possessing cultural heritage interests. The low
   proportion of sites registered in Norway (an estimated 20\%) combined
   with current rates of damage gives the location of archaeological sites
   and their vulnerability to land use change high priority. To optimise
   use of the results for landscape planning, the study describes analysis
   at two hierarchical scales: (1) the regional level-where the aim was to
   locate combinations of environmental resources suitable for human
   use-for application in strategic planning; and (2) the landscape
   level-where identifying and delimiting cultural environments for local
   planning was the aim. This paper focuses on one type of archaeological
   site, Bronze and Iron Age grave mounds. The project used geographic
   information systems (GIS) for the analysis and mapping of landscape
   characteristics that indicate zones with a high probability of
   possessing cultural heritage interest. These zones covered ca. 12\% of
   the forested areas of the region yet captured 94\% of the registered
   grave mounds. New fieldwork confirmed the presence of new sites in the
   zones identified. Results have increased our understanding of
   archaeological site location in Norway and the close links between
   landscape ecology and archaeology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {The susceptibility of a Baltic salmon stock Salmo salar (Indalsalv,
   central Sweden) to Norwegian Gyrodactylus salaris (Figga strain, central
   Norway) was experimentally tested and compared with previously obtained
   results on East Atlantic salmon (Lierelva, SE Norway). Contrary to
   expectation, the Baltic salmon, which had no prior exposure to this
   parasite strain, appeared almost as susceptible as the Norwegian salmon
   parr that naturally experience G. salaris-induced mortality.
   Individually isolated salmon of both stocks sustained G, salaris
   infections with little evidence of innate resistance. A few individuals
   of the Indalsalv stock controlled their infection from the beginning,
   but overall there was considerable heterogeneity in the course of
   infection in both stocks. On individual hosts, G. salaris growth rates
   declined steadily throughout the infection, a trend which was
   particularly marked amongst the Lierelva stock. On shoaling Lierelva
   fish, there was some evidence of reduced parasite population growth
   towards the end of the infection; this was not apparent in Indalsalv
   fishes. These results reflect a growing awareness that not all Baltic
   salmon may be resistant to Norwegian G, salaris, and that Norwegian and
   Baltic G. salaris strains may differ in virulence. Consequently,
   management decisions concerning this parasite-host system should be
   based upon the actual, and tested, susceptibility of stocks under
   consideration and not upon identification of stocks as either Atlantic
   or Baltic.},

   increased and then decreased reflecting the growth, and cutting of the
   grass. Habitats were not used in relation to their availability. Early

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {443-455},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Classic life-history theory and extensions thereof can readily explain
   variation in egg size among populations and individuals. However, most
   such models assume that there is some degree of predictability in
   offspring environment. Offspring provisioning when environments vary
   unpredictably is more problematic and may lead to bet-hedging (i.e.
   reducing variance in fitness). Bet-hedging may involve the production of
   fewer and larger offspring (conservative) or of variable-sized offspring
   (diversified). The use of diversified bet-hedging theory to explain
   within-clutch variation is common but controversial, and simulation
   models have shown that the fitness benefits of such variability depend
   critically on the shape of the egg size-offspring fitness curve. Here,
   we use one of the few empirically derived egg size-offspring fitness
   functions (from Atlantic salmon) in conjunction with simulations to
   examine the plausibility for the evolution of such bet-hedging
   strategies. We show that conservative bet-hedging can be a viable
   strategy for dealing with unpredictable environments, while diversified
   bet-hedging is rarely selectively advantageous (i.e. only under
   extremely variable environments), and then only for purely annual
   organisms. This is supported by empirical evidence from iteroparous
   Atlantic (n = 37 populations) and semelparous Pacific (n = 26
   populations) salmon where less than 3\% of the variation in egg size
   among wild fish is due to within-clutch variability. Only under novel
   (rare) rearing conditions, such as captive rearing to maturity in
   freshwater, was a significant increase in within-clutch variation
   observed. These patterns in conjunction with the modelling results
   indicate that within-clutch variation, at least in salmon, is more
   likely a reflection of the direct influences of the rearing environment
   on a female's ability to allocate resources evenly than of evolutionary
   adaptation. Future work in the area of egg size evolution in
   unpredictable environments may benefit from a stronger focus on
   conservative rather than diversified bet-hedging.},

Abstract = {Electromyogram (EMG) telemetry studies that involve remotely monitoring
   the locomotory activity and energetics of fish are contributing
   important information to the conservation and management of fisheries
   resources. Here, we outline the development of this rapidly evolving
   field and formulate the studies conducted that utilize this technology.
   To date, more than 60 studies have been conducted using EMG telemetry
   that spans 18 species. Several general trends were observed in the
   methodology of the studies that we have highlighted as standards that
   should be adopted associated with transmitter customization, electrode
   placement and surgical technique. Although numerous studies have been
   methodological, there are still some deficiencies in our basic
   understanding of issues such as the need for individual calibration and
   the method of reporting or transforming data. Increasingly, this
   technology is being applied to address issues in conservation,
   management and aquaculture production. At present, the technology has
   been most frequently applied to the study of animal activity or
   energetics and to migration. Several recent studies have also focused on
   addressing more basic questions in ecological and evolutionary biology
   (e.g. parental care dynamics) similar to the large body of literature
   that has been collected for other taxa (e.g. marine mammals, birds),
   using activity telemetry. Collectively, studies conducted using EMG
   telemetry have contributed important information on free-swimming fish
   that was previously difficult to obtain. EMG telemetry is particularly
   effective for examining behaviour at temporal and spatial scales that
   are difficult using other techniques. The development of an ultrasonic
   transmitter based on the same proven principles as those used in the
   current radio transmitter technology will permit studies in other
   environments (i.e. marine, brackish, deep water) and on different
   species of fish. We encourage the continued development and refinement
   of devices for monitoring the activity and energetics of free-swimming
   fish, and also encourage researchers to consider EMG telemetry as a tool
   for addressing questions that are not effectively answered with other
   techniques.},

Abstract = {In most of Fermoscandia, moose Alces alces is intensively managed by the
   use of age and sex specific harvesting. This includes strong male biased
   harvesting, which over the last decade has resulted in a change in the
   sex and age composition of the populations. During the same period of
   time, a reduction in the proportion of male calves in the harvest has
   occurred all over Norway, probably reflecting a change in the secondary
   sex ratio. In order to examine for any causal link between these two
   patterns, we manipulated the structural composition of an isolated
   island population of moose in northern Norway and at the same time
   closely monitored the variation in the secondary sex ratio. In the first
   stage of the project, which was assumed to represent the conditions in a
   natural, unhunted moose population, the proportion of male calves
   increased significantly with the age of their fathers. Potentially, as a
   consequence of the high mean adult male age in the population, the
   secondary sex ratio was highly male biased. When we altered the male
   segment of the population, leaving only young (less than or equal
   to2(1)/(2) years old) males as potential mates for the females, a
   significant increase in the proportion of female calves occurred in the
   population. Finally, in the last 3-years stage of the project, we
   reduced the adult sex ratio in the population to about 23\% males and
   kept the adult male age relatively high. This again led to an increasing
   secondary sex ratio. These results suggest that the age composition of
   males in the population may affect the secondary sex ratio. The general
   significance of these results was supported by a larger temporal
   decrease in the proportion of males that were shot in the areas of
   Norway with larger changes in the sex composition of the hunting quotas
   than in the regions in which a less extreme harvest strategy were
   practised.},

Abstract = {Ptarmigan and grouse species (Lagopus spp.) are thought to be able to
   compensate for a modest harvest because there is a surplus of breeding
   birds that are prevented from breeding by territory holders. To estimate
   the degree of harvest-mortality compensation reliably we experimentally
   harvested 0\%, 15\% and 30\% of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus)
   on 13 estates ranging from 20 to 54 km(2) in size during four hunting
   seasons in Norway according to a regional block design. Population
   overwinter growth rate was strongly negatively density dependent, but
   despite this, and contrary to earlier findings, only 33\% of the harvest
   was compensated for. The lack of compensation was probably caused by
   long-distance juvenile dispersal that was unaffected by the harvest. The
   need for large-scale management experiments to detect the effects of
   harvest was clearly demonstrated: lack of compensation was found only
   when we used the whole dataset and not when the data were analysed by
   year or block. Our study shows that it is very difficult to demonstrate
   a population's lack of harvest compensation and warns against using
   small-scale, out-of-season or poorly replicated studies as a basis for
   future harvest-management decisions.},

Abstract = {1. Phytophagous beetles on six mature living trees and two dead trees of
   Brosimum utile (Moraceae) were surveyed during 1 year in a tropical wet
   forest in Panama. The dead trees were surveyed both as suspended in the
   canopy and after falling down to the understorey.
   2. Canopy access was provided by a construction crane and sampling was
   performed by beating and hand-collecting. The same amount of time was
   spent on each tree in order to standardise sampling effort. A list of
   all species associated with the tree is presented.
   3. A total of 3009 individuals representing 364 species were collected.
   Tourists were excluded from the analyses by recording host associations
   directly and by probability assessments of host associations based on
   abundance categories. A total of 2603 individuals and 244 species were
   associated with the tree. The proportion of tourists in the trees
   increased with sample size.
   4. A single mature living tree had on average 58.5 +/- 6.5 species. The
   local species richness of B. utile was estimated as 2.5 times higher
   than in a single mature tree; however, a substantial increase in species
   richness was attained when dead wood habitats were included. Saproxylic
   species made up 82\% of the total material.
   5. The investigated habitat types of B. utile constituted distinct,
   complementary species assemblages. Similarity between saproxylic species
   of dead suspended wood and dead understorey wood of the same tree was
   0.2 (Morisita-Horn index), confirming a prominent vertical
   stratification among this guild.},

Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {110-115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. If phenotypes differ in habitat preferences there may be a decrease
   in intraspecific competition with increasing phenotypic variation,
   causing heterogeneous populations to perform better than homogeneous
   ones. Furthermore, if the relative performance of different phenotypes
   depends on environmental conditions, population heterogeneity may buffer
   populations against temporal environmental variation.
   2. Here these hypotheses are tested using 10 experimental populations of
   juvenile Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) reared across a range of five
   different water discharges. Each population consisted of fish of
   identical parental origins to control for genetic differences among
   populations, but differed in body size heterogeneity owing to
   differences in egg size distributions.
   3. No effect of population heterogeneity on final body size or dispersal
   rates was detected. Thus, egg size heterogeneity does not appear to
   influence the average level of intraspecific competition in Atlantic
   Salmon.
   4. There was a strong positive effect of water discharge on body size,
   but no effects of phenotypic heterogeneity on variation in final body
   size among discharge levels. Thus, the relative growth performance of
   juveniles arising from different egg sizes may not change sufficiently
   with environmental changes for egg size variation to create a strong
   buffering effect against year-to-year variation in environmental
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Commercial utilization of inland fish resources can constitute an
   important addition to other economic activities in rural communities.
   Based on a case study of commercial whitefish fishery in Lake Femund, a
   mountain lake in southeastern Norway, this article outlines experience
   gained and indicates some of the general problems related to this type
   of economic activity, They concern aspects such as resource biology,
   product development and marketing, economic management, and staff
   recruitment. An initial hypothesis of the study was that commercial
   fishery would have a significant impact on the whitefish stock, causing
   fluctuations in yield and consequent variations in the economy of the
   fishery. Therefore, the study included an analysis of marketing
   possibilities for whitefish products, as well as of the social and
   socioeconomic conditions sustaining whitefish fishery in the local
   community. Nearly 20 years of data show that commercial fishery in Lake
   Femund, with a yield of up to I kg per ha, has a low to moderate
   exploitation rate. Thus, fishery itself does not generate fluctuations
   in the fish population that would influence yields. The major
   restrictions on the enterprise are related to other aspects, such as
   problems of economic and technical management of this specialized
   small-scale industry, difficulties in the recruitment of fishermen to a
   short-season fishery in a time when the employment pattern in the
   community is changing from seasonal activities in agriculture to
   full-time employment in manufacturing and services, and the challenge of
   developing and marketing competitive products for a niche market.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {109-129},
Abstract = {We surveyed residents' attitudes toward common urban animals and their
   participation in animal-oriented activities in the city of Trondheim,
   Norway. The results show that people most like small birds, squirrels,
   butterflies, hedgehogs, ducks, geese and dogs, and dislike bats, snails,
   invertebrate species, mice and rats. Birds of prey, foxes, cats,
   bumblebees, magpies, pigeons, badgers, gulls, grasshoppers and crows
   received a neutral ranking. Generally, females more than males liked the
   popular and neutral species, while males more than females liked the
   less-preferred animals. A negative association was found between age of
   respondents and preferences for birds of prey, dogs, cats, badgers,
   bats, mice and rats. This relation was positive for some invertebrate
   species, and small and medium-sized birds. A positive correlation was
   found between educational level of the respondents and preference scores
   for most of the species listed. Watching television programs about
   nature (59\% often/very often) and watching/feeding birds (41\%) were
   the most frequently reported animal-related activities. When walking in
   the neighborhood, important animal-related motives for doing this were
   to observe birds (42\%) and to observe mammals (34\%). Interest in bird
   observation and television programs about nature increased with
   increasing age. Few respondents reported experiencing problems with
   wildlife, but dogs and cats were more often (36\%) considered to create
   problems. These results indicate that wildlife plays an important role
   in shaping urban residents' daily experiences, and that both animals and
   their habitats should have a higher priority in urban planning and
   management. (c) 2004 International Society for Anthrozoology},

Abstract = {The noble crayfish, Astacus astacus, is highly valued from a
   recreational and economical point of view. In most noble crayfish areas,
   there are long traditions of crayfish catching. The noble crayfish is
   also included in national and international Red Lists as a vulnerable or
   threatened species. Intuitively, the first thought is that such a
   species should be protected from exploitation. However, in many cases
   the possibility for exploitation and local economic benefits may be
   important for the conservation of the species. For the noble crayfish
   this is especially true. The greatest threat against noble crayfish is
   the man-facilitated spread of plague-carrying alien crayfish species. If
   local people are allowed and encouraged to catch and make a benefit from
   noble crayfish, this is also the best protection against illegal
   stocking of alien crayfish. The possibility to exploit the crayfish is
   of major importance for the will to protect. Examples from Norway
   showing different ways of getting an economical and recreational outcome
   from the noble crayfish are presented.},

Abstract = {The Glomma and Halden watercourses in Norway were hit by crayfish plague
   in 1987 and 1989. Reintroduction of the noble crayfish started in 1989
   in the Glomma and in 1995 in the Halden watercourse. Norway has
   especially good conditions for reintroduction of the native crayfish
   after crayfish plague, as there is no alien plague-carrying crayfish
   species in the country.
   In the Glomma watercourse, approx. 15 000 adult crayfish and 10 000
   juveniles have been stocked while in the Halden watercourse the figures
   are 19 000 adults and 26 500 juveniles. All stocking sites were
   previously regarded as very good crayfish localities. Four years after
   stocking, natural recruitment was recorded at all adult crayfish
   stocking sites in the Glomma watercourse and at most sites in the Halden
   watercourse. Current crayfish density is, however, much lower than
   pre-plague densities even at the sites where population development has
   been in progress for more than 10 years.
   Extensive post-stocking movements were recorded among adult crayfish.
   Some sites seemed more suitable for settling, resulting in a great
   variation in CPUE between the different test-fishing sites. Juveniles
   seem more appropriate as stocking material if the goal is to
   re-establish a population in a particular area, due to their stationary
   behaviour, which seems to remain as they grow larger.},

Abstract = {The aim of this roundtable session was to discuss reintroduction of
   native crayfish and habitat restoration providing practical
   recommendations of value to environmental authorities, decision makers
   and local managers.
   A (re)introduction may be appropriate: a) to reintroduce a population
   recently lost, b) to extend the distribution of an ICS into historic
   range and c) to create new or isolated populations to conserve genetic
   diversity or the species. Before (re)introduction it is imperative to
   demonstrate the probability that the receptor locality is empty of
   crayfish, to know the reason for crayfish extinction, and that the
   reason is removed before restocking.
   Before restocking, the receptor locality should also be assessed for
   crayfish suitability, including: water type and chemistry, physical
   conditions (shelter), presence of crayfish plague, risk of NICS,
   predatory fish.
   In general, major constraints in a restocking project is money and
   availability of stocking material. General recommendations: a) if have
   abundant/readily available and acceptable donor population use adults
   and young/juveniles as available, b) if short of stock boost with
   hatchery rearing, and c) if want population quickly, stock as many as
   can afford and several times. Trade offs: time vs. cost. Genetic
   distinctiveness/possible spread of diseases must be considered. In
   general, the preferential ranking is donor from: 1) same watercourse, 2)
   same catchment, 3) adjacent catchment or one nearby in the same
   biogeographic region for crayfish, and 4) any other catchment.
   Habitat restoration can be a valuable action, and should be prioritised
   to: 1) give greatest overall benefit to the ecosystem, 2) benefit ICS
   and 3) be achievable and cost effective. Natural characteristics of
   waterbodies in local area should be considered.
   A key factor in the protection of ICS populations is the knowledge and
   attitude of local people. Objectives and actions should be agreed with
   local stakeholders to improve chances of success.},

Title = {Individual access to preferred habitat affects fitness components in
   female roe deer Capreolus capreolus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {73},

Abstract = {1. Many studies have reported variation in life-history traits and
   reproductive success within populations. One potential source for the
   reported variation is fine-scale spatial variation in habitat quality.
   2. In this study the effects of differences in home-range quality on
   individual fitness were investigated in a roe deer population in an
   agricultural-woodland mosaic landscape in central Norway.
   3. Compositional analysis revealed that woodland was the most preferred
   habitat: its availability was therefore used as an index of home-range
   quality.
   4. It was found that the quality of the does' winter home-range affected
   fawn production in the subsequent spring, as females with greatest
   availability of preferred habitat during winter produced the larger
   litters the subsequent spring.
   5. Furthermore, the winter weights of the fawns seemed to be affected by
   home-range quality in a complex way. First, home-range quality in the
   prenatal winter seems to influence the birthdate and in turn the weight
   of the fawns in August. Also there was an immediate effect of the
   quality of the home-range that the fawns occupied during the postnatal
   winter.
   6. These results are not consistent with the ideal free distribution
   theory, suggesting that the mechanisms for roe deer spacing behaviour
   should be re-examined.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Congruence between changes in phenotypic variance and developmental
   noise in inter-population hybrids was analysed to test whether
   environmental canalization and developmental stability were controlled
   by common genetic mechanisms. Developmental stability assessed by the
   level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA), and canalization by the within- and
   among-individual variance, were measured on several floral traits of
   Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae). Hybridization affected
   canalization. Both within- and among-individual phenotypic variance
   decreased in hybrids from populations of intermediate genetic distance,
   and strongly increased in hybrids from genetically distant populations.
   Mean-trait FA differed among cross-types, but hybrids were not
   consistently more or less asymmetric than parental lines across traits.
   We found no congruence between changes in FA and changes in phenotypic
   variance. These results suggest that developmental stability (measured
   by FA) and canalization are independently controlled. This study also
   confirms the weak relationship between FA and the breakdown of coadapted
   gene complexes following inter-population hybridization.},

Abstract = {Juvenile and adult anadromous trout Salmo trutta utilize the sea for
   feeding during the winter in the Skagerrak. This finding conflicts with
   the traditional view that anadromous trout overwinter in fresh water.
   Adults, just prior to spawning, were captured at sea in October to
   December, and spent fish were caught at sea from October to April,
   showing that the fish may leave the stream and move to sea just after
   spawning and spend the winter there. During mid-winter (January to
   February), the feeding probability (chance of finding a fish with food
   in its stomach) increased markedly with increasing body length, with no
   similar effect during early and late winter (October to December and
   March to April). Among individuals with food in their stomach (72-5\%),
   there was no evidence for variation in feeding intensity {[}stomach
   fullness = (mass of stomach content) (fish body mass)(-1)] among early,

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We studied reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) distribution in
   relation to possible travel barriers (roads and power lines) in
   south-central Norway, 1997-2000, using lichen biomass as an indicator of
   reindeer use. We recorded lichen cover on both sides of potential
   barriers within comparable habitat in 42 sites for 3 different reindeer
   herds. We used cover-biomass regressions to assess the relationship
   between lichen cover and biomass. In 2 of the regions, lichen biomass
   was 5.3 times and 2.8 times higher in areas isolated by 2 parallel power
   lines and an adjacent winter-closed road compared to biomass on the
   other side of the potential barrier. In a third region, lichen biomass
   did not vary significantly between areas on either side of a single
   ``inter-closed road. Lichen biomass data suggested that wild reindeer
   used both sides of a closed road in winter, whereas 2 parallel power
   lines and a winter-closed road in combination reduced reindeer migration
   and resulted in very different grazing pressures on either side of the
   power lines, even 30 years after the power lines were constructed.
   Construction of power lines, and particularly parallel power lines,
   should thus be avoided in wild reindeer habitat. Fragmentation of wild
   reindeer ranges in Norway results in a substantial reduction in
   available ranges and traditional migration routes between important
   seasonal ranges, with a likely overall reduction in carrying capacity.},

Title = {Phenotypic and environmental correlates of tooth eruption in red deer
   (Cervus elaphus)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {262},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-89},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In ungulates, a set of deciduous teeth is replaced by a set of permanent
   teeth during their first 2 years of life. Little is known about factors
   causing variation in timing of tooth eruption, but overall size,
   condition or mineral deficiencies may play a role. The pattern of
   incisor (I) and canine (C) eruption was investigated in 2241 yearlings
   from five populations of red deer Cervus elaphus in Norway during
   1964-2001. Before the sampling period (10 September 15 November), I-1
   had erupted in most yearlings (97\%), while eruption of I-3 and C had
   barely started (erupted in 7\% and 5\% of individuals, respectively).
   Exactly 50\% of the yearlings had erupted I-2. Jawbone length was shown
   to be a main determining factor for eruption of I-2. However, for a
   given jawbone length, there was large variation among populations in the
   proportion of yearlings with erupted I-2 (from < 20\% to > 75\%).
   Females got their permanent I-2 earlier than males. Tooth eruption was
   found to be later with increasing local deer density, even after
   correcting for body weight. There was a residual effect of body weight
   (a measure of condition) after body size (measured as jawbone length)
   was controlled for in one of five populations, indicating that overall
   condition may influence timing of tooth eruption in this area. There was
   no evidence that calcium was limiting for eruption, as no correlation
   was found between timing of eruption and limestone in bedrock. Since
   there is large variation in timing of tooth eruption among red deer
   populations even after controlling for differences in phenotype and
   environmental factors, genotypic variation may also play an important
   role for tooth eruption patterns.},

   effects were answered before any clues were given about snowmobiles
   being an issue. Results showed that relative to the control group,
   skiers who encountered a snowmobile had their affective quality

   effect on participants' beliefs about the extent to which noise from
   snowmobiles disturbed the quality of ski-touring in general.},

Abstract = {The prospects for persistence of Glaucium flavum in Norway were
   evaluated by integrating data concerning spatio-temporal distribution,
   plant growth and development, reproduction, dispersal, seed bank and
   genetic variability. The distribution of Glaucium flavum in the Oslo
   Fjord region is much more restricted now than before. Out of the
   formerly recorded 35 populations, only eight populations were present in
   1998, all in the outer parts of the fjord. The species is a short-lived
   iteroparous perennial in Norway. This growth habit gives high
   reproductive output from fertile individuals. G. flavum is
   self-compatible and can easily reproduce even in small populations. The
   ability to disperse long distances on water is limited. The observed
   seed bank will therefore enhance survival. No variation in isoenzymes
   was observed neither within nor among the G. flavum populations in the
   Oslo Fjord region. The species should be considered Endangered in
   Norway, according to the criteria given by IUCN.},

Pages = {583-592},
Abstract = {To elucidate the population dynamics and biogeographic connections of
   Mertensia maritima in the North Atlantic we studied the genetic
   variation within and among 16 local populations in the Oslofjord region
   (south-east Norway), Finnmark (northern Norway), Iceland and Svalbard,
   using starch gel isozyme electrophoresis. We also tested the
   self-compatibility experimentally. Mertensia maritima was found to be
   self-compatible and able to self-pollinate by autodeposition. The total
   level of genetic variation was extremely low. All the screened
   individuals were homozygous at all loci. All individuals from the
   populations of mainland Norway and Iceland were isozymatically
   identical, whereas individuals from Svalbard differed from these at
   three loci (AAT-1, PGM-3 and SKD-2). The genetic identity between any
   population at Svalbard and any population on the mainland was 0.86.
   These genetic patterns may have resulted from a combination of
   inbreeding, frequent local population extinctions, and long-distance
   dispersal. The isozymatic distinctness of the Svalbard populations is
   consistent with the arctic distribution of the morphologically based
   var. tenella, here raised to subspecific rank as Mertensia maritima ssp.

Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {617-628},
Abstract = {The prospects for persistence of Eryngium maritimum in its northern
   distribution area was evaluated by studying historical data, matrix
   modelling, dispersal, seed germination and molecular variation.
   Historical data revealed a fragmented distribution of small populations
   with decrease in both population numbers and size during the last 150
   years. Fruits of E. maritimum were found to have a relative low floating
   ability, making the prospects of long distance water dispersal more
   limited than would be expected from the world distribution of the
   species. Germination was found to be low (< 25 \%). Elasticity matrices
   showed that survival of reproductive plants were more important than
   reproduction. High juvenile mortality and low germination activity
   emphasised the importance of rapid growth and survival. The population
   insurance against natural catastrophes and environmental stochasticity
   is suggested to be in a ``root bank{''} of established individuals that
   are able to tolerate disturbances due to clonal reproduction and
   regrowth from root fragments. Isozyme electrophoresis revealed low
   molecular variation on a large geographical scale. The chromosome number
   is 2n = 16. A high degree of fixed heterozygosity suggests that the
   species is tetraploid with basic chromosome number x = 4. The
   persistence prospects of E. maritimum in its northernmost distribution
   area are considered low considering the small population sizes, the low
   dispersal ability and low germination.},

Abstract = {When seeking to resolve complex land-management issues, geographical
   assessment of resources that are in short supply or in dispute can aid
   the communication of knowledge and the understanding among and between
   different stakeholders. In this paper, we illustrate how remote sensing
   and GIS can be used to gather and compile information regarding land-use
   activities and patterns among reindeer herders and other land users
   (forestry, mining, tourism, etc) in northern Sweden. The project
   represents a novel user-oriented effort largely based on the work
   carried out by-the principal end user, i.e. the reindeer herders
   themselves. The basis for development of land-use plans for reindeer
   husbandry, was the following: to collect and digitally systemize
   traditional ecological and landscape knowledge of reindeer habitat use;
   to integrate this information with results from field inventories and
   satellite-based vegetation classifications; to map activities of other
   land users. The resulting land-use plans provide information that can
   facilitate consultation between the reindeer herders and other
   stakeholders and can facilitate operational work in reindeer management.
   This project can serve as a model for participatory involvement and
   planning, bringing indigenous knowledge and advanced remote-sensing
   techniques together in an interactive process.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. The aim of this 4-year observational study was to test for the
   presence of direct and delayed density-dependent larval melanism in the
   geometrid moth species Operophtera brumata (winter moth) in northern
   Norway.
   2. Data from many populations with a wide range of population densities
   in time and space facilitated statistical analyses that could separate
   the effects of current and past density. The data also included
   different phases of the 10-year population cycle of this species so that
   eventual non-linear density effects due to population phase could be
   detected.
   3. The results showed that the prevalence of melanism had a strong
   positive, linear relation to population density within years, whereas
   there was no evidence for a delayed effect from the year before or
   dependency on the phase of the population cycle.
   4. In combination, these results limit the range of possible
   explanations of larval melanism in this outbreaking species. The
   possible reasons why winter moth larvae might benefit from
   crowding-induced melanism are discussed.},

Title = {Temporal variation in survival of mammals: A case of environmental
   canalization?},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {84},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3294-3306},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In an age- or stage- structured population, a given change on a
   proportional scale of different fitness components has different effects
   on the population growth rate. Because earlier studies have shown that
   variability is selectively disadvantageous for long-lived iteroparous
   species, fitness components whose variation has greatest impact on the
   population growth rate are expected to be canalized against temporal
   variability. We present here a test for such a canalization of fitness
   components most influential for population growth. If canalization
   occurs, (1) within a given population the variance of canalized fitness
   components should be less than that of noncanalized components, and (2)
   among populations an inverse relationship should occur between the
   potential demographic impact of fitness components and their temporal
   variability. We tested these hypotheses using data on age-dependent
   survival of ungulates. As expected for long-lived vertebrates,
   elasticities and sensitivities of adult survival were consistently
   higher than for juvenile survival. In support of the canalization
   hypothesis, the variance of juvenile survival with low potential
   demographic impact on fitness was consistently higher than the variance
   of adult survival with high potential demographic impact on fitness, in
   all of 22 ungulate populations for which long-term demographic
   monitoring data were available. However, a negative co-variation between
   potential impact on fitness and temporal variation could also be
   accounted for by alternative hypotheses, the lower resistance of growing
   individuals to environmental ``insults,{''} or reduced adult phenotypic
   variability due to selective mortality of juveniles. To differentiate
   between canalization of adult survival and frailty/selective mortality
   of juveniles, we included five populations of small mammals. We then
   found a negative relationship between the relative potential impact of
   age-dependent survival on fitness and the relative variability of
   age-dependent survival, especially for populations faced with high
   environmental variation. This remained true after correcting for
   differences in mean survival of juveniles and adults and was independent
   of phylogeny. Although more data are required to extend the hypothesis
   to other taxonomic groups, we conclude that available data support the
   idea that adult survival of ungulates is canalized against temporal
   variation. Therefore, contrasted responses of juvenile and prime-age
   survival to environmental variaton in ungulates may be adaptive and
   could be viewed as a bet-hedging strategy.},

Abstract = {Life history, habitat utilisation, and biomass of benthic and pelagic
   opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta) were studied in the oligotrophic Lake
   Jonsvatn, central Norway. Sampling in the pelagic zone was done by means
   of a closing zooplankton net; in the benthic zone by means of a benthic
   beam trawl.
   M. relicta had a mixed one or two year life cycle. In the autumn, the
   proportion of mature females and males were larger in the pelagic than
   in the benthic habitat. Copulation took place in late autumn, and the
   first females with eggs occurred in November. In February, the first
   juvenile M. relicta were released in the benthic habitat. In May and
   July, however, juveniles were found in large numbers in all parts of the
   lake. The length distribution of M. relicta indicates that juveniles
   partly segregate between benthic and pelagic habitats. Both juvenile and
   adult M. relicta performed vertical diel migrations in the pelagic
   habitat. In the benthic habitat, diel vertical migrations along the
   bottom were not as pronounced as vertical migrations in the pelagic
   habitat. In the benthic habitat, major migrations were performed only by
   adults in the autumn. Our results indicate that the light intensity in
   the green part of the spectrum gives the proximate cue for regulation of
   vertical distribution of M. relicta.
   The mean total biomass varied between 288 and 1576 kg dry weight,
   corresponding to 23.2-127.1 mg dry weight m(-2) surface area. M. relicta
   had smallest biomass during late spring/early summer and largest biomass
   during autumn and early winter. Estimated pelagic biomasses were largest
   in February, August, October and November, while benthic biomasses were
   largest in May and July. Estimated biomass of pelagic M. relicta during
   autumn was approximately 1/10 of the estimated biomass of zooplankton in
   this lake.},

Title = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the regulated River Alta: Effects of
   altered water temperature on parr growth},

Abstract = {The chief objective of this study was to analyse the effects of altered
   water temperature, due to the hydropower regulation of the River Alta,
   on growth of Atlantic salmon parr. The river was developed for
   hydroelectric purposes in 1987. A 110 m high concrete dam was built in
   the main river 49 km upstream from the outlet to the sea. The outlet of
   the power station is located 2.5 km downstream from the dam. The annual
   regime of water temperature has been altered downstream from the power
   station because of the regulation. It has decreased 1-2degreesC during
   June, July and the first half of August, while it has increased up to
   3degreesC during late summer. During winter, water temperature has
   increased from 0degreesC to about 0.3-0.4degreesC. Atlantic salmon is
   the predominant fish species in the river. They can penetrate 46 km from
   the sea, up to the outlet of the power station.
   In this paper I have studied the relationship between growth of juvenile
   Atlantic salmon and water temperature in the upper part of the river. At
   similar temperatures, the growth rate of salmon parr in the River Alta
   is higher in early summer than later in the growing season. In early
   summer the salmon grew faster than the maximum rate predicted by a
   recently published model. Therefore, I adjusted the model to describe
   growth rates of salmon in early summer (ice break to mid-August), using
   data derived prior to the hydropower development (1981-1986).
   The new model proved effective at describing growth rates of fish in
   early summer following the hydropower development (1987-1996). After
   development, growth rates decreased during early summer, but increased
   correspondingly later in the season. There was close agreement between
   these growth changes and the altered annual regime of river temperature.
   Overall, only minor changes in annual growth rates have been observed
   after the hydropower development. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {The occurrence of hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia in forest patches in a
   heavily human-impacted landscape with a matrix dominated by agricultural
   fields in northeastern China was documented four times during autumn and
   spring 2000-2002. The occurrence of hazel grouse in fragmented
   landscapes in Europe is influenced by patch isolation, size and
   composition. In China, we found that patch composition and size, and
   their interaction, best explained the pattern of hazel grouse
   occurrence, with a greater probability that grouse were found in larger
   patches with more deciduous trees. In contrast to results from Europe,
   isolation distance was not an important explanatory variable. In
   addition, hazel grouse in China used patches with a higher deciduous
   component. Thus, although still vulnerable to habitat fragmentation,
   Asian hazel grouse seem to be less vulnerable than European hazel
   grouse. One reason may be that Asian hazel grouse are adapted to more
   open, deciduous-dominated habitats and form flocks in winter, which may
   allow them to move more freely over open habitats to forest patches.
   Continued habitat fragmentation and the planting of small forest patches
   to coniferous-dominated forest are detrimental to hazel grouse in the
   study area. Future plantings should contain more deciduous trees and
   consideration to the landscape effects reported here should be given.},

Abstract = {Latitudinal gradients in population dynamics can arise through regional
   variation in the deterministic components of the population dynamics and
   the stochastic factors. Here, we demonstrate an increase with latitude
   in the contribution of a large-scale climate pattern, the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO), to the fluctuations in size of populations of two
   European hole-nesting passerine species. However, this influence of
   climate induced different latitudinal gradients in the population
   dynamics of the two species. In the great tit the proportion of the
   variability in the population fluctuations explained by the NAO
   increased with latitude, showing a larger impact of climate on the
   population fluctuations of this species at higher latitudes. In
   contrast, no latitudinal gradient was found in the relative contribution
   of climate to the variability of the pied flycatcher populations because
   the total environmental stochasticity increased with latitude. This
   shows that the population ecological consequences of an expected climate
   change will depend on how climate affects the environmental
   stochasticity in the population process. In both species, the effects
   will be larger in those parts of Europe where large changes in climate
   are expected.},

Abstract = {The applicability of a gill filament-based ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase
   (EROD) assay, originally developed in rainbow trout, was examined in
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus),
   Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), saithe (Pollachius virens) and spotted
   wolffish (Anarhichas minor). All species but spotted wolffish showed
   strong EROD induction in tip pieces of gill filaments following 48 h of
   exposure to waterborne beta-naphthoflavone. Atlantic salmon parr, smolts
   held in freshwater and smolts transferred to seawater showed EROD
   induction of similar magnitude. Arctic charr, differing 11-fold in body
   weight, showed similar EROD activities as expressed per gill filament
   tip. Laboratory exposure of saithe to water and sediments collected at
   polluted sites, resulted in strong EROD induction. In conclusion, the
   gill filament assay seems useful for monitoring exposure to aryl
   hydrocarbon receptor agonists in various species. Furthermore,
   smoltification status, water salinity and body size proved to have minor
   influence on gill filament EROD activity. However, the results in
   spotted wolffish show that some species may be less suitable for
   monitoring using the gill assay. Assessment of gill filament EROD
   activity in fish exposed to polluted water and sediments in the
   laboratory proved to be an easy and cost-effective way to survey
   pollution with dioxin-like chemicals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {137},

Abstract = {A central issue in ecology is to what extent food limitation and
   predation affect animal populations. We studied how survival and
   reproductive success was related to the female's size in a population of
   semi-domesticated reindeer during 2 years where there was a large
   difference in snowfall during winter. The females were kept within a
   predator-free enclosure for about 5 weeks during the calving period and
   thereafter released to their natural summer pastures. Small females were
   more likely to fail to reproduce and they produced smaller calves than
   large females. Additionally, small females were more likely to loose
   their calves due to starvation within the predator-free enclosure and to
   predators outside the enclosure. Food limitation during the harsh winter
   appeared to be the major cause of deaths. However, food limitation
   interacted with predation and led to high calf losses when the females
   experienced low food availability during the harsh winter. In contrast,
   predators killed no calves after the mild winter. Apparently, the
   interaction between predation and food limitation is due to small
   females favouring their own growth and survival over calf production in
   summers following harsh winters with food shortage. Our results indicate
   that a compensatory relationship exists between mortality due food
   limitation and predation. Thus, the impact of calf predation on reindeer
   demography and population dynamics may be limited.},

Abstract = {Whereas the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects weather and
   climate variability worldwide, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   represents the dominant climate pattern in the North Atlantic region.
   Both climate systems have been demonstrated to considerably influence
   ecological processes. Several other large-scale climate patterns also
   exist. Although less well known outside the field of climatology, these
   patterns are also likely to be of ecological interest. We provide an
   overview of these climate patterns within the context of the ecological
   effects of climate variability. The application of climate indices by
   definition reduces complex space and time variability into simple
   measures, `packages of weather'. The disadvantages of using global
   climate indices are all related to the fact that another level of
   problems are added to the ecology-climate interface, namely the link
   between global climate indices and local climate. We identify issues
   related to: (i) spatial variation; (ii) seasonality; (iii)
   non-stationarity; (iv) nonlinearity; and (v) lack of correlation in the
   relationship between global and local climate. The main advantages of
   using global climate indices are: (i) biological effects may be related
   more strongly to global indices than to any single local climate
   variable; (ii) it helps to avoid problems of model selection; (iii) it
   opens the possibility for ecologists to make predictions; and (iv) they
   are typically readily available on Internet.},

Abstract = {We made monthly surveys of > 2000 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus)
   from 1977 to 1987 before and after the construction of the Blue Lake
   hydroelectric reservoir in order to study the progressive impact of
   infrastructure development on wildlife. Following this development,
   reindeer densities within a 4-km radius declined gradually during winter
   to 8\% of pre-development densities without significant changes in
   undeveloped control sites. During summer, reindeer gradually reduced use
   of areas within 4 km distance from roads and power lines to 36\% of
   predevelopment density, with subsequent 217\% increase in use of the few
   remaining sites located >4 km from infrastructure. Reindeer reproduction
   declined progressively as habitat was lost. Assessments of individual
   development projects seriously underestimate the long-term effects of
   the entire expanding infrastructure network. Piecemeal development has
   resulted in an estimated 70\% loss of undisturbed reindeer habitat
   across the last century in Norway. During this time the reindeer
   population has become fragmented into 26 isolated sub-populations. Our
   results show that any further infrastructure development will put the
   remaining European population of wild mountain reindeer at great risk,
   as further habitat fragmentation will make the remaining undisturbed
   patches too small for holding viable populations. A general model of
   impacts of infrastructure on wildlife is presented. We discuss the
   importance of controlling piecemeal development in infrastructure for
   conservation of wildlife and argue that minimizing infrastructure
   development is likely one of the largest challenges in wildlife
   conservation ahead. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The marine survival and growth of wild and hatchery-reared Atlantic
   salmon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {40},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Catches of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. decreased in the 1980s and
   1990s over its entire area in the North Atlantic and smolts were often
   released for stock enhancement. However, there are questions about their
   survival and performance relative to fully wild fish. This paper reports
   on the survival and sea growth of River Imsa salmon released from 1981
   to 1999 as 1- and 2-year-old hatchery and wild smolts.
   2. Survival was significantly higher for wild than hatchery fish.
   Hatchery salmon released as 2-year-old smolts had lower survival, were
   captured more in coastal than freshwaters, grew more slowly and attained
   maturity younger than corresponding 1-year-old smolts.
   3. The survival rate of hatchery fish released as 2-year-old smolts, but
   not 1-year-olds and wild smolts, decreased during the 1980s and 1990s.
   Growth rates at sea, adult size and the proportion of multi-sea-winter
   fish of all three groups also decreased over time.
   4. Catches in coastal relative to freshwaters were higher for two- than
   one-sea-winter fish. Salmon captured in coastal water were greater in
   length than those captured in rivers. Mean specific growth rate at sea
   was similar for wild and hatchery salmon released as 1-year-old smolts,
   and higher than in hatchery fish released as 2-year-olds.
   5. The proportion of two-sea-winter salmon correlated positively with
   the specific growth rate in the first year at sea. Total capture of wild
   adult salmon in rivers and Norwegian home waters each year correlated
   positively with the specific growth rate in the first year at sea. The
   same correlation held for hatchery fish released as 2- but not
   1-year-old smolts.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The coastal fishery was size-selective in
   reducing the size and age of salmon. Releases of 1-year-old smolts were
   financially more profitable than those of 2-year-olds. Decreasing
   production of River Imsa salmon since 1981 was chiefly caused by reduced
   sea-age at maturity and growth rate at sea of both hatchery and wild
   fish. A counteracting measure would be to reduce the size selectivity of
   the salmon fisheries.},

Abstract = {Bimodal population size and age distributions in Arctic char (Salvelinus
   alpinus (L.)) and hypotheses on growth patterns generating bimodality
   have drawn considerable attention during the last decade. However, such
   bimodality has also been suggested to be an artefact of biased sampling.
   We examined published data sets reporting bimodal size distributions in
   gill-net samples of Arctic char in order to confront hypotheses on
   growth patterns generating bimodal population size distributions. Growth
   patterns were derived from published length-at-age data. Simulations
   revealed that the observed growth patterns evidently could not generate
   a bimodal population size distribution. The basic reason for this was
   that growth did not stagnate strongly enough in the largest size classes
   of Arctic char. The reliability of growth approximations from
   length-at-age data was supported by empirical data on back-calculated
   growth trajectories. Furthermore, differences in year-class strength
   cannot explain all of the observed bimodal size and age distributions in
   gill-net samples, as they have been reported to persist over time. Thus,
   bias in the sampling procedure, which overestimates the frequency of old
   and large fish, is retained as the only plausible explanation for stable
   bimodal size distributions often observed in Arctic char gill-net
   samples.},

Abstract = {Seasonal pattern of energy content was determined in a population of
   Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), living in an ultraoligotrophic
   alpine lake (altitude 1100 m) located in central Norway (62degrees5'N).
   Specific somatic energy content varied between 4.3 and 6.1 kJ.g(-1) in
   spawners and between 4.8 and 6.6 kJ.g(-1) in immatures. Corresponding
   values for specific somatic lipid energy were 0.5-1.6 kJ.g(-1) for
   spawners and 0.7-2.1 kJ.g(-1) for immatures. The temporal pattern in
   storage energy residuals (deviation from mean storage energy, all
   sampling periods pooled) indicated that total, protein and lipid energy
   accumulated in the autumn and early winter. This increase was followed
   by a winter decrease in somatic energy (January to April). A new
   increase in total somatic energy and somatic lipid energy occurred
   during late winter (March/April to June), while the lake was still ice
   covered and water temperatures ranged between 0.5 and 2.5degreesC. The
   observed seasonal pattern of specific energy storage and lipid
   deposition demonstrated a considerable potential for energy accumulation
   in Arctic char at low temperatures. It is discussed whether freshwater
   lakes at high altitudes or latitudes represent a temperature-stabilised
   and predictable environment in contrast to the variable temperature
   experienced in the corresponding terrestrial system.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether the experimental nutrient
   enrichment of littoral rocky shore communities would be followed by a
   predicted accumulation of fast-growing opportunistic algae and a
   subsequent loss of perennial benthic vegetation. Inorganic nitrogen (N)
   and potassium (P) was added to eight concrete mesocosms inhabited by
   established littoral communities dominated by fucoids. The response to
   nutrient enrichment was followed for almost 2 1/2 years. Fast-growing
   opportunistic algae (periphyton and ephemeral green algae) grew
   significantly faster in response to nutrient enrichment, but the growth
   of red filamentous algae and large perennial brown algae was unaffected.
   However, these changes were not followed by comparable changes in the
   biomass and composition of the macroalgae. The biomass of opportunistic
   algae was stimulated only marginally by the nutrient enrichment, and
   perennial brown algae (fucoids) remained dominant in the mesocosm
   regardless of nutrient treatment level. Established rocky shore
   communities thus seem able to resist the effects of heavy nutrient
   loading. We found that the combined effects of the heavy competition for
   space and light imposed by canopy-forming algae, preferential grazing on
   opportunistic algae by herbivores, and physical disturbance, succeeded
   by a marked export of detached opportunistic algae, prevented the
   fast-growing algae from becoming dominant. However, recruitment studies
   showed that the opportunistic algae would become dominant when free
   space was available under conditions of high nutrient loading and low
   grazing pressure. These results show that established communities of
   perennial algae and associated fauna in rocky shore environments can
   prevent or delay the accumulation of bloom-forming opportunistic algae
   and that the replacement of long-lived macroalgae by opportunistic
   species at high nutrient loading may be a slow process. Nutrient
   enrichment may not, in itself, be enough to stimulate structural changes
   in rocky shore communities.},

Abstract = {To find out whether modern conservation treatments alter the level of
   metals in feathers, we analysed the content of 10 metals in feathers
   before and after skins were washed with detergent and treated with Eulan
   U-33 (a commonly used preservative at museums). Feathers of 31 birds of
   Goshawk Accipiter gentilis, Eagle Owl Bubo bubo, Feral Pigeon Columba
   livia domest. and Common Eider Somateria mollissima were analysed. We
   found that in most cases metals were partly washed out of the feathers,
   but the effects were related to species and type of feather. The value
   of bird skins as indicators of environmental metal load is therefore
   affected by this treatment. It is recommended that the conservation
   techniques used at museums should be reconsidered if skins are intended
   for specimen banking for future reference in environmental monitoring
   schemes and research.},

Abstract = {We studied the relationship between increasing age and blood
   concentrations of four persistent organochlorines (OCs),
   hexachlorbenzene (HCB), oxychlordane,
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and
   2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorbiphenyl (PCB-153), in arctic-breeding glaucous
   gulls (Larus hyperboreus). We measured OC concentrations in 31
   individuals of known age and took repeated blood samples of 64
   individuals in different years, either one year apart or three or four
   years apart. The age of individuals was not related to the blood
   concentrations for any of the four compounds, and in birds whose values
   were measured repeatedly, there was no effect of the length of time
   (number of years) between sampling events on the relative change in OC
   concentration. This indicates that steady-state levels were reached
   before the age of first breeding. However, breeding area significantly
   influenced the changes in OC concentration between sampling events. In
   areas in which birds fed on prey from higher trophic levels, the OC
   concentrations showed large increases between sampling events; in areas
   in which birds fed at lower trophic levels, OC concentrations increased
   relatively little or not at all. This indicates that individual birds
   had different equilibrium concentrations, which are reached at different
   ages depending on the intake of OCs through the food. It also indicates
   that some individuals had not reached steady-state concentrations at the
   onset of reproduction. Changes in body condition and amount of blood
   lipids were of lesser importance than trophic level and influenced the
   concentrations of HCB and oxychlordane more strongly than DDE and
   PCB-153. In conclusion, this study indicates that steady-state
   concentrations of persistent OCs are reached early in life in most
   glaucous gulls, considering the long life span of the species.},

Title = {Population stability in salmon species: effects of population size and
   female reproductive allocation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {72},
Number = {5},
Pages = {811-821},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. Population stability (i.e. level of temporal variation in population
   abundance) is linked commonly to levels of environmental disturbances.
   However, populations may also differ in their propensity to dampen or
   amplify the effects of exogenous forces. Here time-series of population
   estimates were used to test for such differences among 104 populations
   of six salmon species.
   2. At the species level, Atlantic (Salmo salar L.), chinook
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha Walbaum) and coho salmon (O. kisutch W) were
   less variable than sockeye (O. nerka W) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha
   W). Chum salmon (O. keta W) was more similar to sockeye and pink salmon.
   These differences may be related in part to differences in body size,
   and hence susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions, at the
   time when they migrate to the sea or lakes.
   3. At the population level no effect of fecundity on variability was
   found, in contrast to findings for marine fishes, nor of egg size.
   Whereas substantial differences in the temporal stability of
   environmental factors among geographically close populations may
   override any effects of fecundity or egg size in fresh water, this is
   less likely in the marine environment where spatial autocorrelations of
   environmental variability are more pronounced.
   4. Variation in population sizes was related positively to the duration
   of time-series when using standard deviations of In-transformed
   population estimates, and also when using linearly detrended population
   variation, suggesting non-linear long-term abundance trends in salmon
   populations that extend beyond the 7-year period of the shortest
   time-series.
   5. When controlling for differences among species, stability increased
   with increasing population size, and it is hypothesized that this is due
   to large populations having a more complex spatial and genetic structure
   than small populations due to wider spatial distribution. The effects of
   population size on stability, as well as differences in stability among
   species, suggest that population- and organism-specific characteristics
   may interact with exogenous forces to shape salmon population dynamics.},

Title = {Selecting indicator traits for monitoring land use impacts: Birds in

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted
   to normative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause
   large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable
   for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study,
   we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify
   species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental
   attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage
   of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence
   detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a
   set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and
   environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12
   different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively
   consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic
   regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the
   species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use
   impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and
   long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly
   spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous
   foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were.
   related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of
   species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only
   the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests
   responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects
   of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space
   (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental
   linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use
   impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major
   environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should
   also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits.
   Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making
   predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in
   response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be
   evaluated in monitoring programs.},

Abstract = {The kelp Laminaria hyperborea is host for a rich fauna of mobile
   invertebrates. Dispersal patterns of these animals may be crucial for
   their availability to visual predators like fish, which are known to
   search for food in these productive habitats. Diurnal, horizontal and
   vertical dispersal within and out of the kelp forest were studied by
   analysing colonization of artificial substrata placed among kelps. The
   species composition of the fauna was different on three parts of the
   kelp: lamina, stipes (with epiphytes) and holdfast. The artificial
   substrata were colonized mainly by species associated with kelp. More
   species and individuals colonized the artificial substrata at night than
   during the day. The most abundant faunal groups on the kelps and the
   artificial substrata were amphipods and gastropods. Both groups
   dispersed at a significantly higher rate at night than during the day.
   Rapid horizontal dispersal out of the kelp forest was found. The
   artificial substrata were also colonized quickly by kelp fauna at all
   vertical levels inside and above the kelp forest. However, species
   associated with the kelp holdfast tended to disperse close to the
   bottom, while stipe-associated fauna moved through all parts of the kelp
   forest and even above the canopy layer. A high dispersal rate appears
   common amongst the mobile species living on kelp and seems to be
   advantageous, despite the risks involved in emigrating from the habitat
   and being exposed to predators. Higher activity at night may reduce
   availability to predators.},

Abstract = {The kelp Laminaria hyperborea forms large forests and houses a numerous
   and diverse fauna, especially in the kelp holdfast and stipe epiphytes.
   Kelp harvesting creates cleared areas and fragmentizes the kelp forest.
   We investigated the dispersal ability of kelp fauna to cleared,
   harvested areas by studying their colonization pattern to artificial
   substrata (kelp mimics) exposed for a short (3 days) and longer time
   period (35 days) at different sites within the kelp forest (one site)
   and at a cleared area (two sites). Most of the kelp fauna (111 species)
   showed a rapid dispersal and colonized the artificial substrata within
   the cleared area. The similarity of the faunal community in the mimics
   with the natural kelp holdfast community increased with the length of
   the exposure period. During the experiments, 87\% of the mobile species
   in the kelp plants were found in the kelp mimics, indicating good
   dispersal for slow-moving animals like gastropods, polychaetes and
   tube-building crustaceans. Relating the frequency of the different
   faunal groups in the untrawled kelp forest to their frequency in the
   kelp mimics, showed gastropods, amphipods and decapods to have
   relatively high dispersal rates, whereas isopods, bivalves, polychaetes
   and tanaids showed a lower dispersal rate than expected. Amphipods
   dispersed as juveniles and adults. No significant differences were found
   between the faunal composition and number of species in the mimics
   placed inside the kelp forest and in the cleared area. Remaining
   holdfasts and pebbles were identified as refuges/alternative habitats in
   the harvested area, and may together with the nearest kelp vegetation,
   serve as sources for colonization to new substrata. The high dispersal
   ability of most of the kelp fauna provides maintenance of the faunal
   composition of disturbed habitats and ensures colonization of recovering
   algal habitats regardless of reproduction strategy.},

Abstract = {Fauna associated with the common kelp along the Norwegian coast,
   Laminaria lyperborea, was sampled at four sites covering 1000 km of
   coastline. Exploitation of the kelp habitat by the fauna, and the ways
   in which habitat size and seasonal variations affect the kelp fauna
   community were analysed. The study focused on mobile macrofauna, of
   which 238 species were found on 56 kelps sampled, with an average
   density of almost 8000 individuals per kelp. Amphipods and gastropods
   were the most diverse and abundant fauna groups. The species composition
   was different on the lamina, stipe (with epiphytic algae) and holdfast.
   A similar pattern of epiphyte- and holdfast-fauna composition was found
   for all regions. Lowest diversity and abundance were found on the
   lamina, and highest diversity in the holdfast. Highest abundance was
   found on the stipe in summer, but there were large variations between
   sites and seasons, from a few individuals to more than 80 000 animals
   per stipe. Neither seasonal changes nor variation in habitat volume
   affected the number of species significantly, but abundance was
   significantly related to season and habitat volume. These variations
   were most pronounced for stipe fauna. Laminaria hyperborea offers a
   heterogeneous habitat exploited by a diverse and abundant invertebrate
   community, its abundance depending on local and regional variations in
   kelp size.},

Abstract = {Annual home-range size indices for 36 male and 52 female adult brown
   bears Ursus arctos in two study areas in central and northern
   Scandinavia were estimated to evaluate factors believed to influence
   home-range size. Male home ranges were larger than home ranges of lone
   females after controlling for the sexual size dimorphism acting on
   metabolic needs. Further, home ranges of females with cubs were smaller
   than home ranges of lone females and females with yearlings. Thus,
   differences in metabolic need were not able to explain the variation in
   range size among females of different reproductive categories or between
   males and females, suggesting roaming behaviour of males in this
   promiscuous species. Home-range size in both males and females was
   inversely related to population density along a density gradient that
   was not linked to food availability. This contradicts the hypothesis
   that females use the minimum areas that sustain their energy
   requirements. However, on a large geographical scale a negative
   relationship between range size and food availability was evident. The
   annual home ranges in inland boreal environments in Scandinavia are the
   largest reported for brown bears in Eurasia, and similar to those in
   inland boreal and montane environments in North America.},

Title = {Reduced immunocompetence and cost of reproduction in common eiders},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {136},
Number = {3},
Pages = {457-464},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Immunocompetence may be especially important in long-lived species where
   infectious organisms may have detrimental effects upon future
   reproductive value of hosts. The resource demand for immunocompetence
   may reduce resource availability for reproduction and a trade-off
   between these traits has therefore been proposed. Capital breeders, such
   as the common eider (Somateria mollissima), rely upon accumulated body
   reserves during reproduction. Eiders lose more than 40\% of pre-breeding
   body mass during egglaying and incubation and many females abandon their
   ducklings to other females after hatching. Results from our
   observational study show that levels of leukocytes (i.e., lymphocytes,
   heterophils and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) are not related to body
   mass early in the incubation period. However, eider females with low
   initial body mass showed signs of immunosuppression (i.e., decreased
   late levels of lymphocytes) and increased response towards stressors
   (i.e., increased heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) later in the incubation
   period. Moreover, females with low lymphocyte levels more frequently
   abandoned their brood, and females abandoning young had an increased
   return rate to the next breeding season. However, among brood abandoning
   females return rate was lower for the females with low lymphocyte
   levels. These results suggest that immunosuppression, as indicated by
   low lymphocyte levels, is a reproductive cost that may be partly
   compensated for by abandoning young.},

Abstract = {Co-occurrence in food requirements of offspring and food availability is
   a key factor determining breeding success. Prey availability is
   typically dependent on environmental conditions that are different from
   those influencing the predator's decision regarding whether or not to
   initiate breeding, and is not always optimal at the peak of reproduction
   requirements. We investigated this relationship to understand better
   what determines the fledging success of the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula
   arctica). Colony data from Rost (northern Norway) covering a period of
   27 years were analysed with parallel data on sea temperature and the
   size and abundance of the puffins' main prey (the Norwegian
   spring-spawning herring, Clupea harengus). By fitting statistical models
   to the fledging success, we found that one effect of climate on this
   population of Atlantic puffins is indirect and mediated by sea
   temperature affecting the availability of first-year herring. The best
   model also demonstrates that the breeding success of the Rost puffins
   may be quantitatively predicted from the size of first-year herring and
   sea temperature.},

Abstract = {I manipulated egg size and followed individual mass trajectories from
   the egg stage in Atlantic salmon to test for effects of size, and for
   interactions between size and paternal body mass, on offspring
   performance in strongly food-limited environments. Egg size had a strong
   effect on body mass at yolk absorption, causing juveniles originating
   from large eggs to outgrow their siblings from small eggs. This
   corroborates previous findings of egg size effects under more benign
   environments, and demonstrates that positive effects of egg size on
   offspring success are manifested even under strong food-limitation.
   Previously reported negative effects of being large during the critical
   period for survival in dense populations are thus likely related to
   social interactions, rather than to effects of density on total food
   abundance in the environment. The effect of egg size on offspring
   performance, and hence the optimal egg size, was independent of paternal
   body mass.},

Abstract = {1. Data on seasonal ranges of 93 radio-collared adult brown bears (Ursus
   arctos ) were used to test hypotheses explaining variation in range size
   in relation to male and female reproductive strategies.
   2. Both males and oestrous females used large ranges in the mating
   season, but decreased their ranges after the mating season. These
   results suggested that both sexes in this species roam to mate, because
   the results could not be explained by a seasonal change in food
   availability nor by increased foraging movements of oestrous females to
   replenish body reserves after previous cub raising.
   3. Females with cubs-of-the-year (cubs) restricted their range size in
   the mating season and increased their ranges in the post-mating season.
   This finding suggests that females with cubs restricted their ranges to
   avoid contact with infanticidal males, an important cause of cub
   mortality, because the proposed alternative explanation - limited
   mobility of small cubs - was unable to explain the small size of mating
   season ranges.
   4. Our results suggest that range size in females is influenced by
   sexually selected infanticide, selecting for large mating season ranges
   and multiple mating in oestrous females to hide paternity and for
   restricted mating season ranges in females with cubs to avoid
   infanticidal males.
   5. To our knowledge, we are the first to report a significant
   relationship between seasonal range size and reproductive status in
   female brown bears and the first to report an effect of oestrus on
   seasonal range size in female carnivores.},

Abstract = {We examined the effects on life-history characteristics of altering the
   age distribution and proportion of male moose (Alces alces) present in
   an isolated island population. We expected that such changes in
   population structure would reduce the mean adult male body mass because
   of increased energetic expenditure during the rut at younger age. We
   also expected delayed parturition and/or reduced fecundity in females,
   due to a lack of acceptable males during the rut. We first studied
   variation in body mass and fecundity in an unmanipulated (unhunted)
   population for 3 years. We then manipulated the age composition of the
   male segment of the population, leaving only young (less than or equal
   to2.5-yr-old) males as potential breeders during 2 rutting seasons.
   Finally, we reduced the adult sex ratio in the population to about 25\%
   males during the last 3 years of the project. We found no effects from
   the manipulation of male age composition on age-specific variation in
   body growth of males, age at maturity of females, or fecundity rate.
   However, a delay in the mean parturition date occurred when the
   composition of the male segment was manipulated. Moreover, the
   structural changes in the male segment affected calf body mass the
   winter following birth, as mass decreased with parturition date. Such a
   decrease may produce long-term demographic effects on the population
   because variation in many life-history traits of ungulates is closely
   related to the body mass of young females. Our results indicate that
   manipulation of the composition of the male segment of an ungulate
   population may have important demographic consequences, which should be
   considered when choosing harvest strategies.},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {309+},

Abstract = {Controversies over the return of large carnivores (e.g. wolves) are
   often interpreted as clashes between rural traditionalism and urban
   modernity. Rural communities, however, have never been culturally
   monolithic, and modernization increases their diversity. However, the
   popular image is one of rural communities united against vermin and
   urban romantics. An important reason for this is probably the successful
   construction of the anti-carnivore front as a last line of defence
   against destructive forces threatening rural life. Drawing on examples
   from a study in circle dividesterdalen, Norway, the struggle against
   wolf protection is discussed as an instance of symbolic construction of
   community Images of a threatened community are vital to the
   self-understanding of the wolf adversaries, but cleavages run through
   the alliance. Three principal groups may be identified: sheep farmers,
   landowners who lease hunting, and people with strong ties to traditional
   land use practices (primarily hunting) and a rural working-class
   culture. These groups have not always been allies, and conflicts of
   interest run through the `resistance front. The task here is to identify
   the social forces that now bring them together, and to explain why the
   carnivore issue is well suited as a significant component in their
   symbolic construction of community.},

Abstract = {A numerical method for computing the eigenvalue variance effective size
   of a subdivided population connected by any fixed pattern of migration
   is described. Using specific examples it is shown that total effective
   size of a subdivided population can become less than the sum of the
   subpopulation sizes as a result of directionalities in the pattern of
   migration. For an extension of the model with threshold harvesting and
   local deterministic logistic population dynamic we consider the problem
   of maximizing the total harvesting yield with constraints on the total
   effective size. For some simple source-sink systems and more complicated
   population structures where subpopulations differ in their degree of
   isolation, it is shown to be optimal, for a given total effective size,
   to raise the harvesting thresholds relatively more in small and in
   isolated populations. Finally, we show how the method applies to
   populations which are supplemented, either intentionally or
   unintentionally. It is shown that the total effective size can be
   reduced by several orders of magnitude if the captive component of a
   population is much smaller than the wild component, even with symmetric
   backward migration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Releases of cultured organisms, such as farm Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar L.), threaten native biodiversity and the integrity of natural
   communities. Salmon escaping from sea farms, however, have relatively
   poor reproductive success, suggesting that the rate of spread of
   domesticated traits may be reduced. We now compare the relative
   reproductive success of males that mature precociously in freshwater
   (parr) and find that those of farm origin have higher breeding and
   fertilization success than wild and hybrid individuals. Specifically,
   hybrid parr had 57\% and wild parr 25\% the success of farm parr. Early
   maturing males could thus be important vehicles promoting introgression
   of domesticated and/or non-native traits into wild populations and
   ultimately have long-term impact on the genetic integrity of native
   populations.},

Abstract = {The upstream migration of 17 radio-tagged adult Atlantic salmon, Salmo
   salar L., past hydroelectric developments on the River Nidelva, Southern
   Norway, was examined. Salmon migrated quickly from the site of release
   in the lower part of the river up to the tunnel outlet of Rygene power
   station, but were substantially delayed at the outlet. The salmon stayed
   in the outlet area for 0-71 days (median = 20), and mainly took up a
   position inside the dark power station tunnel. Water discharge in the
   tunnel was 57-176 m(3) s(-1) , while residual flow in the river between
   the outlet and the dam 2.5 km further upstream was 3 m(3) s(-1) . Ten
   salmon passed the outlet and entered the residual flow stretch, but none
   passed the dam. Six of the 10 salmon returned to the tunnel outlet. No
   major migration barriers were identified in the residual flow stretch,
   suggesting lack of motivation among the salmon to migrate due to either
   low water discharge compared with the main river, or several minor
   migration barriers along the river stretch.},

Title = {Unconventional ventral attachment of time-depth recorders as a new
   method for investigating time budget and diving behaviour of seabirds},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {206},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We tested the use of commercially available electronic time-depth
   recorders (TDRs) to quantify activities and thus total time budgets of
   seabirds. This new method involved first fitting TDRs onto the birds'
   bellies (not on their backs), and, secondly, analysing continuous
   recordings of temperature, light and pressure to differentiate
   activities on land and at sea. The birds studied were 12 common
   guillemots Uria aalge rearing chicks at Hornoya, in northern Norway. The
   method successfully recorded five different activities: at the colony,
   flying, diving, and resting or active at the sea surface. Overall,
   common guillemots spent 68\% of their time at the colony and 32\% at
   sea. While at sea, the birds spent the majority (77\%) of their time at
   the surface, during which they were active 64\% of the time, and rested
   only 13\%. Birds engaged in the costly behaviours of flying and diving
   for shorter times (11\% and 12\% of their time at sea, respectively).
   The method allowed us to differentiate between two types of trips to sea
   based on the presence (foraging trips: 77\% of the total number of
   trips) or absence (non-foraging trips: 23\%) of dives. On average,
   foraging trips lasted 3.2 h, but most trips were shorter (<1 h), during
   which the mean estimated travel distance from the colony was 11 kin.
   Diving occurred in bouts of 7.7+/-6.6 dives (mean +/- S.D.). The mean
   maximum dive depth was 10.2+/-7.6 m (deepest dive: 37 m), and the mean
   dive duration and post-dive intervals were 38.7+/-21.3 s (longest dive:
   119 s) and 20+/-12 s, respectively. Direct and indirect evidence
   suggests that common guillemots had no difficulty in finding food during
   the study period, and that the TDRs had minimal effects on the birds'
   behaviour and physiology. The method is easy to use in the field and is
   applicable to many other flying seabird species; it is therefore an
   efficient way of collecting information on time budgets and diving
   behaviour in the context of various ecological and monitoring studies.},

Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {101},
Number = {3},
Pages = {467-478},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We experimentally explored population- and individual-level effects on
   Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) resulting from resource competition
   with its common European competitor, the brown trout (Salmo trutta). At
   the population level, we compared performance of the two species in
   their natural sympatric state with that of Arctic charr in allopatry. At
   the individual level, we established selection gradients for
   morphological traits of Arctic charr in allopatric and in sympatric
   conditions. We found evidence for interspecific competition likely by
   interference at the population level when comparing differences in
   average performance between treatments. The growth and feeding rates did
   not differ significantly between allopatric and sympatric Arctic charr
   despite lower charr densities (substitutive design) in sympatric
   enclosures indicating that inter- and intraspecific competition are of
   similar strength. The two species showed distinct niche segregation in
   sympatry, and brown trout grew faster than Arctic charr. Arctic charr
   did not expand their niche in allopatry, indicating that the two species
   compete to a limited degree for the same resources and that interference
   may suppress the growth of charr in sympatric enclosures. At the
   individual level, however, we found directional selection in sympatric
   enclosures against individual Arctic charr with large head and long fins
   and against individuals feeding on zoobenthos rather than zooplankton
   indicating competition for common resources (possibly exploitative)
   between trout and these charr individuals. In allopatric enclosures
   these relations were not significant. Diets were correlated to the
   morphology supporting selection against the benthic-feeding type, i.e.
   individuals with morphology and feeding behaviour most similar to their
   competitor, the benthic feeding brown trout. Thus, this study lends
   support to the hypothesis that Arctic charr have evolved in competition
   with brown trout, and through ecological character displacement adapted
   to their present niche.},

Abstract = {During the period 1973-1999, the effects of air pollution on the
   terrestrial ecosystems in the border areas of Norway and Russia have
   been investigated by the use of satellite remote sensing. Landsat
   Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) data, in
   combination with field work data collected in the period 1970-2000, were
   applied to produce land cover maps for seven different years, with an
   overall accuracy of 75-83\%. On the basis of this monitoring, we can
   conclude that the main effect of air pollution was that the areas of
   lichen (Cladina spp.)-dominated forests and mountain heaths were reduced
   from 37\% in 1973 to 10\% in 1994, followed by a slight increase to 12\%
   in 1999. The lichen-dominated vegetation types were changed into
   barrens, partly damaged vegetation entities, and dwarf shrub (e.g.,
   Vaccinium myrtillus)-dominated vegetation. We found a significant
   negative relationship (r=-0.94, p=0.001) between the extent of the area
   of mixed forests with lichen content and the emissions Of SO2 during the
   period. The area of the category industrial barrens had a significant
   negative relationship (r= -0.95, p = 0.001) to the emissions Of SO2
   during the same period. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {During peak smoltification, the interactive effects of cortisol and
   ambient seawater challenge were compared in two strains of Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar) smolts: a domesticated strain, AquaGen and a native
   River Imsa strain. Tissue and blood samples were taken from untreated
   fish on 20 May. Fish were then transferred to experimental tanks,
   allowed to recover for 24 h and cortisol (50 mg kg body mass(-1)),
   dissolved in vegetable oil, or vegetable oil alone (sham) was implanted.
   Samples were taken 5 days post implantation. Fish were then exposed to
   24 It ambient seawater challenge (FW-SW) or freshwater to freshwater
   replacement (FW-FW) and sampled as before. Sham implantation had no
   significant impact on any of the measured parameters. Cortisol
   implantation significantly elevated plasma cortisol in FW-FW Imsa
   smolts, while no effect was observed in FW-SW Imsa smolts. Cortisol
   implantation had no effect on the plasma cortisol levels of AquaGen
   smolts regardless of FW-SW challenge. Increased plasma cortisol
   corresponded with significantly higher plasma glucose levels in FW-FW
   Imsa smolts. Plasma Na+ and Cl- levels were not affected by cortisol
   implantation but were significantly increased in FW-SW smolts of both
   strains. Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity increased in response to cortisol
   implantation in only FW-FW smolts but not FW-SW smolts. Gill
   Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-subunit mRNA levels were not affected by strain,
   cortisol injection or transfer protocol, while both CFTR I and CFTR 11
   mRNA levels were significantly higher in AquaGen versus Imsa smolts
   regardless of treatment. CFTR I mRNA was elevated following cortisol
   implantation in FW-FW smolts from both strains suggesting CFTR I
   expression is under the control of cortisol. These findings also suggest
   that plasma cortisol levels are regulated differently between strains
   and that cortisol implantation and ambient FW-SW challenge interact,
   interfering with the individual effects of each of these factors. (C)

   of Ali raised the gill-aluminum (gill-Al) concentration by 20-30 mug At
   g(-1) gill dry weight compared to control fish having < 10 mug Al g(-1)
   gill dry weight. The fish responded to the At loading with elevated
   blood glucose, but retained more normal hematocrit and plasma chloride
   levels. Fish exposed under acid conditions grew significantly poorer
   than the control fish. After 3 months of exposure, 150 Carlin-tagged
   smolts from both Imsa treatments were released into the non-acidic River
   Imsa, 800 in upstream from a trap that caught all migrating smolts.
   Acid-exposed fish migrated downstream slightly later than the controls.
   At the same time, Carlin-tagged fish from all four treatments (Acid and
   Good, both strains; approximately 1000 fish group(-1)) were released
   downstream of the trap located 150 in above the river mouth. Based on
   the number of adult recaptures (by May 2001), marine survival was
   20-30\% lower for the acid-exposed fish than for the controls. There
   were no differences in marine growth between the treatments. The results
   suggest that even very low concentrations of Ali (6 +/- 2 mug l(-1)) can
   reduce seawater survival, thereby having effect on the population level.
   The physiological responses, reduced growth and reduced marine survival
   also suggest that the presmolts did not acclimate to the acid
   conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Anadromous Arctic charr cease feeding and rely on endogenous energy
   stores during overwintering in fresh water. During spring, they undergo
   seasonal development of seawater (SW) tolerance (hypoosmoregulatory
   capacity) and seaward migratory behaviour. As hormones known to be
   involved in smoltification are also prime regulators of growth and
   metabolism, the present study set out to investigate whether the
   seasonal development of hypoosmoregulatory capacity and accompanying
   changes in cortisol, thyroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor-I
   (IGF-I) levels are influenced by metabolic and nutritional status. In
   addition, the present study also investigated the effect of early spring
   water temperatures (1.5-month advance) on the above parameters.
   Hatchery-reared offspring of anadromous Arctic chaff were either fed or
   fasted from October 1998 to July 1999. In fish held at ambient water
   temperature, hypoosmoregulatory capacity improved from March, and
   reached a level indicating prime SW tolerance in late June.
   Hypoosmoregulatory development was accompanied by significantly higher
   gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, and low levels of thyroid hormones and
   total IGF-I in the fed and fasted groups. Of the hormones investigated,
   only plasma cortisol levels in fasted fish resembled the pattern
   typically seen in smolting salmonids, with peak levels coinciding with
   development of SW tolerance and increased gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity.
   Elevation of water temperature in early spring seemed to impair the
   development of hypoosmoregulatory capacity in this high-Arctic species.
   It is concluded that long-term fasting associated with overwintering
   does not impair seasonal development of SW tolerance in Arctic charr,
   but elevated temperatures in early spring may compromise this
   developmental process. The lack of hormonal changes regarded as typical
   for parr-smolt-transforining salmonids may reflect regulatory
   adjustments at other levels (receptor concentration/affinity, hormone
   turnover and binding proteins). Furthermore, the hormonal changes seen
   in the present study may resemble a seasonal resmoltification typical of
   repeat migrants of this species, rather than parr-smolt-transforming
   first-time migrants. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {One-year-old, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts were
   Carlin-tagged to test the effects of light sedation and salt water
   addition during transporting as well as releasing methods on migratory
   behavior and marine survival in northern Norway. A total of 1600 salmon
   were tagged for the migratory behavior study in the Halselva River. The
   fish were transported in water containing either I mg F 1 metomidate or
   11 g l(-1) balanced sea salt (Instant Ocean), or a combination of the
   two. The groups were then allowed to recover for 2 days in net pens in
   the river, after which they were permitted to migrate freely from the
   net pens located I km upstream from the fish trap. These groups were
   compared to the untreated groups, which were released directly into the
   river at the same releasing site at the same time. The results showed
   that brackish water with metomidate as transport medium, and/or recovery
   after transport led to improved recaptures of smolts compared to
   untreated controls. In addition, two groups of approximately 3000
   Carlin-tagged Atlantic salmon were transported in 1998 by helicopter
   from the research station to the nearby Alta River (1-h transport time,
   including loading) and either released directly into the river or kept
   in a net pen in the river for 7 days before release. The same releases
   were performed in 1999. Recaptures of adult salmon in the Alta River
   were 0.43\% and 1.43\% (1998 releases) and 1.23\% and 1.89\% (1999
   releases) for smolts released either directly or allowed 7 days to
   recover in the river before release, respectively. These results shows
   that the use of stress-reducing methods, especially recovery after
   transport, can improve both the migratory behavior and marine survival
   of smolt releases. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) smolts (45 g) in freshwater (5.4
   degreesC) were exposed to water containing different concentrations of
   metomidate from 0 to 10 mg l(-1), clove oil (eugenol), Aqui-S(TM)
   (iso-eugenol) and Benzoak(R) (benzocaine) from 0 to 100 mg l(-1). All
   anaesthetic concentrations were mixed and expressed as mg l(-1) in
   relation to the active substance of the various anaesthetics.
   Metomidate, clove oil, Aqui-S(TM) and Benzoak(R) were effective as
   anaesthetics for Atlantic salmon smolts at concentrations : greater than
   or equal to 2 mg l(-1) (metomidate) and greater than or equal to 30 mg
   l(-1) (clove oil, Aqui-S(R) , Benzoak(R)). The fish entered behavioural
   stage 4 (failure to respond to external stimuli) within 6.2-2.2 min for
   metomidate concentrations from 2 to 10 mg l(-1), within 8.1-2.2 min
   (clove oil and Aqui-S(TM)) and 17.4-3.0 min (Benzoak(R)) for
   concentrations from 30 to 100 mg l(-1). A concentration of 100 mg l(-1)
   of Benzoak(R), clove oil and Aqui-S(TM) caused the salmon smolts to
   enter stage 5 (arrested opercular activity) after 6.4 and 12 min of
   exposure, respectively Metomidate solutions greater than or equal to 2
   mg l(-1), clove oil and Aqui-S(TM) solutions greater than or equal to 20
   mg l(-1) prevented plasma cortisol elevation above resting level.
   Benzoak(R) (regardless of dosage) did not prevent plasma cortisol
   elevations above resting level. While the anaesthetics increased mean
   plasma lactate concentration significantly in nearly all experimental
   groups, no such changes in plasma glucose were evident in any of the
   experimental groups. The eugenol-based anaesthetics (clove oil and
   Aqui-S(TM)) show promise to become effective anaesthetics, with good
   efficacy at low dosages and with stress-reducing capabilities. They are
   also inexpensive and easily obtained, and are organic substances safe
   for both environment and user. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Relationships between energy density (kJ.100 g(-1)) and body length
   (mm), which varied between life-history stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar), were described by power functions. The variation was chiefly
   caused by differences in lipid concentrations. Energy densities of
   maturing and rematuring parr were higher than those of similarly aged
   smolts. Monthly specific growth rate was higher in maturing parr than in
   salmon at sea. Mature parr males allocated relatively more energy to
   gonadal development and less to soma development than anadromous males.
   Spawning expenditure increased from 34 to 53\% for 55- to 72-cm-long
   females. In males, similar losses were from 47 to 49\% of their total
   energy content at river entry. More energy was used in reproduction in a
   long river than in a short one. Male allocation to gonads relative to
   soma was highest in the shorter river. Energy allocation pattern varied
   among developmental stages. Very energy-rich male parr rematured in
   subsequent years without going to sea; less energy-rich ones smolted and
   migrated to sea.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse self-reported fear of four large carnivore
   species in a representative sample of the Norwegian population. People
   reported the most fear of the two largest and most dangerous carnivores,
   brown bears and wolves, and less fear of lynx and wolverines. Women
   expressed significantly more fear of these species than did men, and
   expressed fear increased with age in both sexes. Human population
   density had very little effect on the degree of self-reported fear of
   large carnivores, but people living in rural areas with one carnivore
   species in their vicinity expressed less fear of this species than
   people from rural areas where this carnivore species was absent.
   Activities related to experience with, or knowledge of, the large
   carnivores also effected fear patterns. People with higher education and
   those who expressed interest in outdoor activities like small game
   hunting and mountain hiking generally reported less fear than did
   respondents with lower education and no interest in outdoor activities,
   respectively. We argue that a good management strategy is to develop
   educational programs where people learn about the biology and habits of
   the large carnivores and are encouraged to gain first-hand outdoor
   experience in areas with large carnivores (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {In brown bears (Ursus arctos), nursing of young >1 year of age has a
   positive effect on their growth rate but is energetically costly for
   mothers and reduces the number of litters a female can produce during
   her lifetime. We followed radiomarked families to study their behavior
   during the period of family breakup. Yearlings separated from their
   mothers during the mating season and most family breakups were
   associated with the presence of an adult male, suggesting that
   termination of maternal care was not initiated by offspring.},

Abstract = {Adaptive management models are designed to include a variety of
   stakeholders, but they may still exclude significant groups. Drawing on
   two Norwegian studies of conflicts over large carnivores, one such group
   is identified as working-class men with strong ties to local hunting and
   ``outdoorsman'' culture. For them, the carnivore controversies are part
   of a conflict between dominant and subordinate cultural forms and bodies
   of knowledge. Representing dominant culture and hegemonic knowledge,
   managers and scientists have a hard time establishing rapport with
   anticarnivore hardliners. It is suggested that joint practical work may
   diminish some cultural barriers, and a project where this has been
   crucial is described. The lynx registration program in southeastern
   Norway brings together biologists, managers, and local hunters in
   practical field work in order to make population estimates. Although
   motivated by a demand for ``exact numbers,'' this project apparently has
   succeeded in narrowing some cultural gaps as well.},

Abstract = {Bumblebees are important pollinators of crops and wild flowers, and
   their foraging range has considerable management interest. It is
   commonly assumed that bumblebees prefer to forage as close to their nest
   as possible. However, a review of the literature shows that there is
   little empirical evidence to support this assumption. An experiment
   aimed at investigating whether bumblebee workers forage close to their
   nests, and distances between three commercially produced bumblebee nests
   and an introduced forage patch were manipulated. The results presented
   here show that bumblebee workers significantly increased their use of a
   flower resource after their nests had been moved from within the
   resource to more than 100 m away. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   traps, and caught more littoral taxa than the more recent,
   net-haul-based survey. Similar faunas were identified in the acidified
   lakes in both surveys, and several good indicator species were
   identified. For example, Acanthocycops vernalis was restricted to lakes
   with pH < 6. Sinobosmina sp. was very common but only in lakes with pH >
   4.8. Tropocyclops extensus, Mesocyclops edax, and Sida crystallina were
   commonly found but only at pH > 5, and Chydorus. faviformis only at pH >
   5.9. These indicators showed promise in gauging the early stages of
   recovery from acidification in 3 lakes that were included in both

Abstract = {We report the first population ecology study of the endangered Chinese
   grouse (Bonasa sewerzowi). The study population was stable during
   1995-2000. Annual rates of survival were 0.64 for adults and only 0.17
   for chicks to 13 weeks of age. Reproductive parameters were 6.1
   eggs/clutch, 63\% nest success, and overall 3.6 chicks
   hatched/female/year. The spring sex ratio was 64\% males, with 44\% of
   the males unmated in spring. Local people found an estimated 10-29\% of
   the nests and took the eggs for food. Only about 9\% of the reserve
   containing the study area is mature mixed forest, the preferred habitat.
   Inadequate brood habitat may have influenced chick survival and the
   skewed adult sex ratio may be a result of habitat fragmentation. We
   recommend protecting the remaining mixed forest, creating more brood
   habitat, and stopping the taking of eggs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {Ecological effects of organochlorine pollutants in the Arctic: A study
   of the Glaucous Gull},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {504-515},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Since the early 1970s, high levels of long-transported organochlorine
   pollutants (OCs) such as PCBs and DDE have been found in seabirds in the
   European Arctic, especially in the Glaucous Gull, Larus hyperboreus.
   However, the potential ecological effects of these contaminants have not
   been studied. We measured the concentrations of 15 different OCs (HCB,
   three HCHs, oxychlordane, DDE, and nine PCB congeners) in the blood of
   111 Glaucous Gulls and related the concentrations to fitness components
   of the same individuals. Blood samples were taken in 1997, and
   individuals were followed until 2000. We first conducted a principal
   component analysis (PCA) on all OCs and related reproductive traits and
   survival. to the first and second PCA axes, which represented persistent
   compounds and more volatile compounds, respectively. We then related
   reproductive traits and survival to all OCs separately, except for
   persistent PCB congeners (for which we used their sum), to test if some
   compounds were more consistently related to negative fitness effects
   than others. Females with high circulating levels of persistent OCs were
   more likely to lay nonviable eggs than were females with low levels,
   whereas levels of more volatile OCs were not related to egg viability.
   Moreover, there was a negative relationship between PC1, in addition to
   female blood concentration of both persistent and some volatile OCs, and
   the hatching condition of the chick from the first egg laid in clutches.
   The hatching condition of the second chick in clutches was significantly
   negatively related to PC1, and specifically to female blood
   concentrations of HCB, beta-HCH, and PCB-28. Apart from a negative
   association between OC concentrations and laying date in both sexes, no
   other reproductive parameters (clutch size, egg size, incubation time,
   nest predation, and early, chick survival) showed associations with any
   of the OCs measured. Hence, reproductive effects were most likely
   related to maternal transfer of persistent OCs to eggs. Adult survival
   was negatively related to blood concentration of DDE, persistent PCBs
   and HCB, and especially to oxychlordane. Survival probability was
   reduced by 29\% in females and 16\% in males as oxychlordane
   concentrations in the blood increased 10-fold (from 5 to 50 ng/k wet
   mass). In long-lived birds, adult survival probability is the parameter
   to which the population growth rate is most sensitive, suggesting that
   persistent OCs have the potential for causing considerable effects on
   the population dynamics of Arctic-breeding Glaucous Gulls.},

Abstract = {1. Movement patterns of two butterfly species (meadow brown Maniola

   172 ha area within a landscape with a high percentage of suitable

   2. Adult resource density, but not patch size or larval food plant
   abundance, influenced the numbers and the fractions of residents,

   3. Differences between species were observed in movement frequency and
   maximum distances moved but not in mean distances moved.
   4. The scarce copper showed much greater movement ability than expected
   from the results of published studies. This is believed to be a result
   of the comparatively large size of the study area and the high cover of
   suitable habitat (>50\%).
   5. The mean and maximum distances travelled by butterflies reflected

   had significantly higher densities than those that were not enhanced. On
   the other hand, rivers with remnant stocks that were supplied with fish
   had significantly lower densities of salmon fry than those that did not
   undergo such mitigation measures. In 2001, all limed rivers yielded 41.9

   species would take through an agricultural landscape matrix between
   habitat fragments by assigning friction values to different habitat
   types. Our model was validated by using empirical data on inter-patch
   movement for two butterfly species: As a measure of the ecological
   distance between habitat patches, the least-cost path model was a better
   predictor of butterfly movement than Euclidean distance. Ranking several
   hypothetical management scenarios, illustrated the potential of the
   model :as a decision-support tool. Removal of all infrastructure from
   within arable fields would significantly reduce rates of inter-patch
   movement. However, if all boundaries between arable fields were restored
   to grassy banks this would significantly increase the connectivity
   between sub-populations. Planners widely recommend using corridors to
   connect fragments of remnant habitat despite relatively little empirical
   evidence to show that dispersal of individuals is enhanced by this
   practice. Our model showed that important aspects of species movement
   and, hence, survival,can be expressed in models suitable for area
   planning and management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights

Abstract = {Individuals of different quality may have different investment
   strategies, shaping responses to experimental manipulations, thereby
   rendering the detection of such patterns difficult. However, previous
   clutch-size manipulation studies have infrequently incorporated
   individual differences in quality. To examine costs of incubation and
   reproductive investment in relation to changes in clutch size, we
   enlarged and reduced natural clutch sizes of four and five eggs by one
   egg early in the incubation period in female common eiders (Somateria
   mollissima), a sea duck with an anorectic incubation period. Females
   that had produced four eggs (lower quality) responded to clutch
   reductions by deserting the nest more frequently but did not increase
   incubation effort in response to clutch enlargement, at the cost of
   reduced hatch success of eggs. Among birds with an original clutch size
   of five (higher quality), reducing and enlarging clutch size reduced and
   increased relative body mass loss respectively without affecting hatch
   success. In common eiders many females abandon their own ducklings to
   the care of other females. Enlarging five-egg clutches led to increased
   brood care rate despite the higher effort spent incubating these
   clutches, indicating that the higher fitness value of a large brood is
   increasing adult brood investment. This study shows that the ability to
   respond to clutch-size manipulations depends on original clutch size,
   reflecting differences in female quality. Females of low quality were
   reluctant to increase investment at the cost of lower hatch success,
   whereas females of higher quality apparently have a larger capacity both
   to increase incubation effort and brood care investment.},

Abstract = {We evaluated preferences of habitat variables by hazel grouse (Bonasa
   bonasia) in an intensively managed boreal landscape in south-central
   Sweden. We surveyed 71 forest patches that varied in tree age, tree
   species composition, structure and field layer, as described by ordinary
   forest stand data. They were surveyed during autumn and spring for 2
   years. A distinct difference in habitat quality, measured as amount of
   vertical cover and development of the field layer, was found among
   patches occupied during spring, patches occupied during only autumn and
   unoccupied patches. We found that the existing nation-wide forest stand
   data are adequate to select habitat patches to maintain hazel grouse in
   managed forested landscapes. However, the stand data would be improved
   if parameters concerning field-layer type, alder and field-layer cover
   were added. We used the results of an earlier study to predict hazel
   grouse occurrence in our studied patches. Unthinned middle-aged (20-69
   years) or old (>90 years) stands rich in deciduous trees (5-40\%),
   including alder, and with a rich field layer were the most often
   occupied patches. Moreover, the low density of hazel grouse in this
   landscape, compared to hazel grouse densities in less intensively
   managed landscapes, clearly showed the influence of forestry on the
   species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fish status survey of Nordic lakes: Effects of acidification,

Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {98-105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The status of fish populations in 3821 lakes in Norway, Sweden and
   Finland was assessed in 1995-1997. The survey lakes were chosen by
   stratified random sampling from all (126 482) Fennoscandian lakes
   greater than or equal to 0.04 km(2). The water chemistry of the lakes
   was analyzed and information on fish status was obtained by a postal
   inquiry. Fish population losses were most frequent in the most highly
   acidified region of southern Norway and least common in eastern
   Fennoscandia. According to the inquiry results, the number of lost
   stocks of brown trout (Salmo trutta), roach (Rutilus rutilus), Arctic
   char (Salvelinus alpinus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) was estimated to
   exceed 10 000. The number of stocks of these species potentially
   affected by the low alkalinity of lake water was estimated to exceed 11
   000. About 3300 lakes showed high total phosphorus (> 25 mug L-1) and
   cyprinid dominance in eastern Fennoscandia, notably southwestern
   Finland. This survey did not reveal any extinction of fish species due
   to eutrophication. One-third of the lakes had been artificially stocked
   with at least one new species, most often brown trout, Whitefish
   (Coregonus lavaretus s.l.), Arctic char, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss), pike-perch (Stizostedion lucioperca); grayling (Thymallus
   thymallus), pike (Esox lucius), bream (Abramis brama), tench (Tinca
   tinca) and European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus). The number of
   artificially manipulated stocks of these species in Fennoscandian lakes
   was estimated to exceed 52 000. Hence, the number of fish species
   occurring in Nordic lakes has recently been changed more by stockings
   than by losses of fish species through environmental changes such as
   acidification.},

Title = {Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L. and Arctic

   histories},

Abstract = {Among the species in the family Salmonidae, those represented by the
   genera Salmo , Salvelinus , and Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are
   the most studied. Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history
   variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta
   L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many
   strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are
   also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in
   a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for
   future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic
   plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully
   freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10
   cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter
   (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning
   life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use
   both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts
   migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some
   populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations
   while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas
   such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in
   estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few
   months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of
   life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with
   Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and
   survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western
   Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and
   now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt
   waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often
   partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds
   elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex
   systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the
   various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and
   near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species
   exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to
   developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy
   available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and
   smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic
   carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular
   food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while
   littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large
   trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more
   inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters.
   Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than
   females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more
   uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost
   freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the
   Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies
   indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic,
   Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin.
   Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in
   most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population
   differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some
   genetic basis. Charr live in streams
   at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep
   areas. Ontogeneti
   The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore
   marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition.
   Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for
   developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found
   in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes
   more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial
   migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among
   populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but
   also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As
   a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for
   studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and
   experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and
   comparative behaviour.},

Abstract = {The post smolt of anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus ) from
   Lake Storvatn, northern Norway (70degrees39'48'), continued to feed and
   grow after their return to freshwater in late summer, but in late autumn
   (October) both their growth rate and feeding intensity ceased along with
   the drop in water temperature. In contrast, adult, sexually mature
   anadromous charr did not appear to feed during their freshwater
   residency. The stomach fullness of post smolts were similar to that of
   resident Arctic charr during early autumn, and their diets were similar,
   being dominated by pelagic prey such as surface insects, Holopedium sp.,
   Bosmina sp. and chironomid pupae. Later in the autumn, the resident
   charr also included some more benthic prey, in particular gastropods,
   whereas the post smolts continued to feed predominantly on zooplankton
   and surface insects, but with a lower stomach fullness than the resident
   fish. This suggests that after arrival in freshwater, the post smolts
   continue their pelagic feeding behaviour displayed during the

Abstract = {Linear body measurements were made on wild Arctic charr Salvelinus
   alpinus parr (100-200 mm L-F) from two populations in northern Norway
   during spring (May), summer (June and July) and autumn (October). To
   reduce handling stress, a method was developed were dorsal and ventral
   body measurements could subsequently be taken easily from a single
   picture of the anaesthetized fish. Multiple regression analyses
   investigated the possible correlation between the body measurements and
   both total and percentage lipid content of the fish. For both
   populations and during all seasons, the regression equations gave better
   estimates for total lipid than for percentage lipid. The regression
   equations for total lipid accounted for between 67.7 and 89.5\% of the
   variance in lipid content for the different seasons within the lakes.
   The pooled data within each lake accounted for 62.9 and 81.0\% of the
   variance in total lipid, while the pooled data for both lakes accounted
   for 67.7\% of the variance. In general, the condition factor alone did
   not give a satisfactory estimate of lipid content of the Arctic charr
   (r(2) = 0.003-0.521). Shrinkage on validation values was high
   (0.20-0.52). Employing a ridge regression method resulted in models with
   lower r(2) values and lower shrinkage values (indicating more stable
   models). Published equations used for hatchery-reared Arctic charr could
   not be used on wild fish from the same population. The close
   correlations between actual and predicted lipid levels found in this
   study show that morphometric measurements can predict total lipid levels
   in wild Arctic charr with reasonable accuracy. The most accurate results
   were obtained when equations were derived from each data set. Therefore,
   the method has the potential within a single study to estimate lipid
   levels in live fish as long as some fish can be sacrificed to develop a
   unique regression equation for each population or experiment. (C) 2003

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Wolverine Gulo gulo populations have a low reproductive potential and
   are thus relatively sensitive to changes in survival rates.
   Consequently, knowledge about survival and mortality causes in juvenile
   wolverines is important for a sound management of the species. We
   estimated survival rates for juvenile wolverines and evaluated the
   relative importance of intraspecific predation compared to other
   mortality causes in northern Scandinavia during 1993-2001. We monitored
   80 radio-marked juvenile wolverines from May to February. Intraspecific
   predation was the most important cause of juvenile mortality and
   occurred during two periods. First, seven juveniles were killed in
   May-June when still altricial, i.e. infanticide. Second, four juvenile
   females were killed by conspecifics outside their mothers' territories
   after independence in August-September. The survival rate of
   radio-marked juveniles during May-February was 0.68. There was a strong
   tendency for survival to be lower during the summer when juveniles were
   altricial, than after they became independent. The estimates of survival
   rates and mortality causes provided by this study are important for the
   understanding of wolverine population dynamics. Currently, our data are
   too weak to suggest an explicit explanation for infanticide in
   spring/early summer. Still, in the light of the available information on
   wolverine life history and infanticide patterns in other species, we
   suggest two, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses to consider for further
   investigation: 1) males kill non-related juveniles to increase their
   reproductive success, and 2) females kill non-related juveniles to
   reduce competition for resources. In addition, attention should be given
   to the alternative hypothesis that infanticide in wolverines is
   non-adaptive. Finally, we suggest that independent juvenile females were
   killed by resident females in territorial defence.},

Abstract = {How animals change their movement patterns in relation to the
   environment is a central topic in a wide area of ecology, including
   foraging ecology, habitat selection, and spatial population ecology. To
   understand the underlying behavioral mechanisms involved, there is a
   need for methods to measure changes in movement patterns along a pathway
   through the landscape. We used simulated pathways and satellite tracking
   of a long-ranging seabird to explore the properties of first-passage
   time as a measure of search effort along a path. The first-passage time
   is defined as the time required for an animal to cross a circle with a
   given radius. It is a measure of how much time an animal uses within a
   given area. First-passage time is scale dependent, and a plot of
   variance in first-passage time vs. spatial scale reveals the spatial
   scale at which the animal concentrates its search effort. By averaging
   the first-passage time on a geographical grid, it is possible to relate
   first-passage time to environmental variables and the search pattern of
   other individuals.},

Abstract = {The migration of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., returning to the River
   Suldalslagen, Norway, was studied in relation to redirection of
   freshwater flow through a power station. The outlet of the power station
   is situated in the Hylsfjord, a fjord adjacent to the river mouth.
   Seventy-two salmon were tagged with acoustic transmitters, released in
   the outer part of the fjord system and automatically recorded when
   entering the Hylsfjord or the river. Data were collected during one
   period when the power station was running and two periods when the power
   station was closed. The release of water from the power station did not
   greatly attract the salmon during their return migration. Proportions of
   salmon entering the river or time from release to entering the river did
   not differ among salmon tagged in the different periods. The salmon were
   recorded in the Hylsfjord both when the power station was running and
   closed and there were no differences in number of times, number of days
   or hours recorded in the Hylsfjord among salmon tagged in the three
   periods. The only significant difference found among periods was
   duration of continuous stays in the inner part of the Hylsfjord. This
   may indicate a slight attraction to the freshwater release, but the
   difference seems small (1.8 vs. 0.7 h) compared with the time the fish
   stayed in the fjord system before entering the river (16-85 days).},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to collect information on angling
   procedures and the effects of hook and release on Atlantic salmon in the
   River Alta, northern Norway, covering both grilse and multi-sea-winter
   salmon in a non-artificial setting with real anglers. Information on the
   angling procedure, handling of the fish and the condition of the fish at
   release was collected for individual salmon in catch logs (n = 543, mean
   body length 82 cm), whereas physiological stress was studied in a
   sub-sample (n = 15, mean body length 77 cm). To study post-release
   behaviour, survival and recapture rates, salmon were tagged with radio
   transmitters (n = 30, mean body length 83 cm) and anchor T-tags (n =
   353, mean body length 79 cm). To evaluate the effects of the hook and
   release programme on the salmon population, number of spawning redds
   were recorded from a helicopter in 6 years during 1989-2000.
   The results showed that at water temperatures 10.0-14.5degreesC, a high
   proportion of the radio tagged salmon (97\%) survived hook and release
   and stayed in known spawning areas during the spawning period. However,
   the behaviour after release seemed to be affected by hook and release.
   Only a small proportion (4\%) of the anchor T-tagged salmon was caught
   more than once within the same season. Increased playing time, increased
   number of runs during the angling event, hooking in the throat, bleeding
   at the hook wound, increased handling time, air exposure and water
   temperature were factors that affected hooked and released Atlantic
   salmon negatively, either indicated by a poor condition at release,
   increased stress levels or unnatural behaviour after release. Number of
   spawning redds were more than doubled after the introduction of
   compulsory release of all angled salmon in Sautso (the upper 16\% of the
   watershed inhabited by salmon) in 1998, which indicates that hook and
   release can be an effective management tool to enhance declining
   Atlantic salmon populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We examined the distribution, migration and origin of wild and escaped
   farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo solar L., in the northeast Atlantic ocean
   north of the Faroe Islands based on individual tagging of salmon in this
   area. Recoveries of wild salmon were reported from home waters in nine
   north Atlantic countries, and in a number of different rivers throughout
   the distribution range of Atlantic salmon, Most tags were recovered in
   Norway, but relatively large numbers of returns were observed in
   Scotland and Ireland as well No fish were recaptured at Farces. Fish
   tagged in the autumn tended to return to areas closer to the tagging
   site than Fish tagged in the winter. This strongly suggests that salmon
   originating from most areas of the distribution range are at some life
   stage present in this area, but in variable proportions at different
   times. Most of the salmon returned home to spawn the next autumn, and
   the fish that stayed for another year originated from northern areas of
   Europe, All recoveries of farmed salmon were in Norway except one on the
   west coast of Sweden, suggesting that they could have escaped mainly
   from Norwegian fish farms Assessment of the proportion of wild salmon
   from different countries present north of the Faroe Islands revealed
   that 40\%, of the fish were of Norwegian origin. and Scotland and Russia
   accounted for about 20\% each. Four tags of wild fish were reported from
   Canada, all in the same year they were tagged, This demonstrates that
   adult Atlantic salmon can cross the north Atlantic ocean in less than 6
   months. (C) 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

   The concentration of defensive compounds increased with height for

Abstract = {Different evolutionary hypotheses have been proposed to explain
   variation in offspring sex ratios among mammalian populations. The
   Trivers and Willard and local resource competition hypotheses, which are
   based on adaptive modification by maternal investment, are two opposing
   hypotheses commonly used for ungulates, but empirical patterns often do
   not fit either hypotheses' expectations. We investigated sex ratio
   variation in 1658 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) calves in relation to
   their mothers' mass and age, while accounting for potential
   density-independent factors such as climate. The most parsimonious model
   included only the effect of maternal age, the proportion of males
   increasing with increasing maternal age. Similar models in terms of
   parsimony included (in addition to maternal age) the winter temperature
   or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index when the mothers were in
   utero, indicating that climatic conditions experienced by mothers in
   their year of birth, have the potential to influence variation in a
   cohort's offspring sex ratio. Thus, a combination of both
   density-dependent and density-independent factors may influence sex
   ratio variation in reindeer and perhaps in other ungulates. We suggest
   that, if an adaptive maternal strategy is present, it may be induced
   and/or inhibited by, or interact with other factors such as climate.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-15},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {According to reproductive strategy theory, males in polygamous breeding
   systems should invest in morphological or behavioral features that
   increase reproductive success. When the early development of such traits
   conflicts with predator protection, we expect that male calves will
   exhibit risk-taking behavior, Such as high activity level and increasing
   distance from mother, to a greater extent than female calves. We
   investigated sex differences in mother-calf distance, calf activity
   levels, and calf mortality in a semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer
   tarandus) population. The results show that male calves stray farther
   away from their mothers, exhibit a higher level of locomotive behavior
   in terms of play and walking, and are more vulnerable to predation than
   are female calves. Although mother-calf distance increased over time in
   1- to 6-month-old calves, no evidence was apparent for an increase in
   sex difference in mother-calf distance over this period. The results
   suggest a trade-off between predation vulnerability and investments in
   behavioral traits thought to be important for future reproductive
   success and Suggest that these sex-related differences in behavior are
   apparent as early as 6 months of age.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We examined potential synchrony in the growth rates of three Svalbard
   reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) populations and tested
   whether this pattern may result from correlated environmental variation.
   Two neighbouring populations had synchronized dynamics during the study
   period, while a more distant population showed different temporal
   variation. Climatic forcing (the Moran effect) was a likely
   synchronizing mechanism in combination with contrasting
   density-dependence patterns between the synchronous and asynchronous
   populations. Local climate was a more important synchronizing agent than
   a regional climate index (the Arctic Oscillation). Nevertheless, our
   results also suggest that variation in climate at a large scale may be
   important. Based on indirect measurements of dispersal/migration, our
   findings indicate that this factor does not play a key role in the
   spatial synchrony of Svalbard reindeer population dynamics.},

Title = {Migratory Atlantic salmon as vectors for the transfer of energy and

Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},

Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-27},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Annual energy, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes across the
   river mouth by Atlantic salmon were estimated for 18 years (1976-94) in
   the Norwegian River Imsa. The total energy content of the emigrating
   smolts in each year varied considerably with a mean value of 237 x 10(3)
   kJ. That of returning adults also varied between years with a mean value
   of 141 x 10(4) kJ. One-sea-winter salmon (grilse) made up 65\% of the
   total energy content of the spawners in the river. Dead carcasses
   remaining in the river after spawning were estimated to have a mean
   annual energy content of 175 x 10(3) kJ.
   2. The net annual energy flux from the sea to the river varied between
   48 x 10(3) kJ (1987) and 152 x 10(4) kJ (1989) with a mean of 616 x
   10(3) kJ, and a coefficient of variation of 67\%. Average net marine
   import of the returning adults was 83 x 10(4) kJ year)(-1) with a
   coefficient of variation of 52\%. Mean annual export of C, N and P to
   sea by the smolts was 595, 131 and 22 kg, and by kelts 1535, 352 and 70
   kg, respectively, whereas gross import via the adults was 3176 kg C, 735
   kg N and 132 kg P. The annual flux across the river mouth was 1046 kg C,
   253 kg N and 39 kg P. The net marine import were 1585 kg C, 371 kg N and
   60 kg P. The net flux was estimated at 0.2\% for nitrogen and 5\% for
   phosphorus of the total river load.
   3. The energy flux caused by Atlantic salmon spawning in the River Imsa
   was relatively high because the general nutrient load in the river is
   low. Thus, even though most Atlantic salmon survive spawning, their
   contribution to the nutrient flux in the river is significant.},

Title = {Modelling hantavirus in fluctuating populations of bank voles: the role
   of indirect transmission on virus persistence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Using field data published in the literature, we investigated
   pathogen dynamics and conditions of persistence in a mathematical model
   of the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus )-Puumala hantavirus system.
   The host population is assumed to have a 3-year periodic cycle. The
   duration of very low host density is critical for virus transmission and
   survival.
   2. Field epidemiological data strongly suggested a transmission of the
   hantavirus by the contaminated environment. We thus studied whether this
   `indirect' transmission affected the virus persistence in the host
   population.
   3. The model assumptions were derived from the following conditions
   found in the literature: (1) there is no additional mortality nor
   fecundity loss due to the virus in infected hosts, thus the cyclic
   demographical pattern is not due to the virus; (2) no remission has been
   observed, thus we did not consider the existence of recovered
   individuals; (3) adult females are territorial and juveniles disperse to
   find a new territory and reach sexual maturity. A fragmented landscape
   was assumed to occur: individuals can live in favourable or unfavourable
   patches.
   4. The model was a compartmental model; the population was structured
   into susceptible or infectious individuals. We considered two age
   classes, juveniles and adults, and two sites (populations) connected by
   juvenile dispersal.
   5. Model dynamics accurately predicted the cyclic trend in disease
   prevalence as observed in epidemiological studies. They also showed that
   indirect transmission significantly increased the probability for the
   virus to persist during the low-density period of the host population.
   More precisely, even a low survival rate of the virus outside the host
   was sufficient to decrease extinction risk of the infection by
   stochastic events.
   6. Elasticity analysis showed a high robustness of the model to changes
   in the parameters of indirect transmission but a high sensitivity to
   changes in adult density.},

Abstract = {Habitat competition in brown trout Salmo trutta and Siberian sculpin
   Cottus poecilopus was investigated by varying density, fish size, and
   species composition in stream channels providing areas of different

   large (86 +/- 6 mm LT) brown trout exhibited strong preference for the
   intermediate (8-11 cm diameter) and large (17-21 cm) gravel substrata.
   There was a tendency for more brown trout to occupy finer (2-4 cm)
   substrata with increasing density, in particular for large brown trout.
   Also, more small brown trout were observed on finer. substrata when
   tested with large brown trout, suggesting interspecific competition for
   restricted space. Both small (56 +/- 6 mm LT) and large (88 +/-10 mm LT)
   Siberian sculpin preferred the large gravel in all tests, and did not
   change their substratum preferences much with increasing densities,
   suggesting higher tolerance for `crowding'. The large Siberian sculpin
   preferred the coarser substratum, and the largest individuals were
   consistently found on it. In sympatry with large Siberian sculpin,
   habitat displacement of brown trout occurred, indicative of
   interspecific competition. A higher proportion of small and large brown
   trout occupied the finer substrata. than in allopatry. Habitat selection
   by large Siberian sculpin appeared to be unaffected by species
   composition and density. Small Siberian sculpin were displaced to finer
   substrata when tested with large Siberian sculpin, suggesting
   intraspecific competition. The results indicate that Siberian sculpin
   are potential habitat competitors for young brown trout. (C) 2003 The

Abstract = {Parasites are exploiting their host for the resources required for the
   parasite's reproduction and survival. The effects of antiparasitic
   treatment during incubation on body mass and return rate in female
   common ciders Somateria mollissima were examined in a two year study
   (1998 and 1999). There was no effect of treatment on nest success, but
   unsuccessful females had lower body mass. Treatment had no effect on
   incubation time, mass-loss during incubation or return rate among
   successful birds. However, treatment lead to higher return rate among
   unsuccessful birds (treated = 69\%, n = 13; controls = 18\%, n = 11).
   This pattern remained significant also after including the birds that
   returned two years after the experiment. We suggest that the
   unsuccessful females are of lower quality and had higher costs from
   parasite infections than birds which completed incubation, and that the
   higher return rate for treated unsuccessful females may mean that costs
   of parasites are substantial, and that the potential fitness gain from
   investment in parasite defense and avoidance is large.},

Abstract = {Habitat selection may occur in situations in which animals experience a
   trade-off, e.g. between the use of habitats with abundant forage and the
   use of safer retreat habitats with little forage. Such trade-offs may
   yield relative habitat use conditional on the relative availability of
   the different habitat types, as proportional use of foraging habitat may
   exceed proportional availability when foraging habitat is scarce, but be
   less than availability when foraging habitat is abundant. Hence,
   trade-offs in habitat use may result in functional responses in habitat
   use (i.e. change in relative use with changing availability). We used
   logistic and log-linear models to model functional responses in female
   polar bear habitat use based on satellite telemetry data from two
   contiguous populations; one near shore inhabiting sea ice within fjords,
   and one inhabiting pelagic drift ice. Open ice, near the ice edge, is a
   highly dynamic habitat hypothesised to be important polar bear habitat
   due to high prey availability. In open ice-polar bears may experience a
   high energetic cost of movements and risk drifting away from the main
   ice field (i.e. trade off between feeding and energy saving or safety).
   If polar bears were constrained by ice dynamics we therefore predicted
   use of retreat habitats with greater ice coverage relative to habitats
   used for hunting. The polar bears demonstrated season and population
   specific functional responses in habitat use, likely reflecting seasonal
   and regional variation in use of retreat and foraging habitats. We
   suggest that in seasons with functional responses in habitat use, polar
   bear space use and population distribution may not be a mere reflection
   of prey availability but rather reflect the alternate allocation of time
   in hunting and retreat habitats.},

Abstract = {Managing complex environments requires suitable tools to integrate data
   from a variety of sources and efficiently analyse and present them
   within a geographical context. Recently there has been a growing
   interest in the integration of geographical, environmental and
   behavioural data for use in coastal zone management and planning. Our
   study shows how easily accessible information on bathymetry, terrain
   variation and wind conditions may be integrated into a georeferenced
   model applied to the study of key species and ecosystems of the
   Norwegian coastal zone. Through case studies, we predicted kelp forest
   (Laminaria hyperborea) distribution and analysed harbour seal (Phoca
   vitulina) habitat selection. Combining information on depth and wind
   exposure derived from a digital terrain model was a suitable approach to
   predict kelp forest distribution, even though the prediction showed
   deviations from information provided by kelp harvesters. Including
   information on sea-bed sediment improved the predictive ability
   drastically, and more investigation is needed to continue this kind of
   modelling. This approach is relevant for making decisions concerning
   site selection of kelp forest harvesting and restoration. Integrating
   the kelp forest prediction model with information on depth and the
   presence of slopes, islands and georeferenced behavioural data, we
   developed a technique for classifying habitats and studying resource
   selection.},

Abstract = {The use of commercially available solid phase extraction (SPE)
   cartridges foe the fractionation of Al and Fe in soil water is
   described. The quantitative determination was done by. inductively
   coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Different types
   of SPE cartridges, based on cation exchange, anion exchange, and
   chelation were studied. To avoid pH changes,,the SPE cartridge should be
   conditioned with a buffer that has a pH close to that of the sample.
   Both strong cation exchange (SCX) and chelation were found to Work well,
   whereas low recovery was observed for Al when anion exchange was used.
   For Fe, the sum of the anionic and cationic fractions that passed
   through the cartridges was nearly 100\%. The results obtained for Al for
   23 soil water samples using a SPE/ SCX cartridge and ICP-AES were
   compared with equilibrium calculations using the program ALCHEMI and
   also with a fractionation method that was based on separation on-a
   manually prepared SCX column and detection by molecular
   spectrophotometry, after complexation with. pyrocatechol violet (SCX-PCV
   method). The SPE/SCX-ICP-AES results for the labile Al fraction (Al
   bound to the SCX cartridge) showed an acceptable correlation with the
   results obtained by the equilibrium calculations, except for the samples
   with the highest DOC concentrations, whereas the values obtained for
   labile Al by the more traditional SCX-PCV method were much lower. We
   recommend that the SPE/SCX-ICP-AES procedure described in this work be
   selected for the fractionation of Al and Fe species in soil and
   freshwater samples.},

Abstract = {We report on a study conducted on free-ranging Africa elephants in the
   woodlands of northern Botswana. We compared bull groups and family units
   with regard to (1) their patterns of habitat use and (2) their ranging
   distances from perennial water sources. During the dry season, adult
   males frequented more habitat types than family units, whereas family
   units used a wider diversity of habitats than bulls during the wet
   season. Bulls roamed widely (>10 km) from perennial drinking water in
   the dry season, when family units congregated within 3.5 km of the
   rivers. During the wet season, when ephemeral pans were abundant, all
   elephant groups were found at intermediate distances (5 km) from the
   rivers. The spacing of elephants in the dry season is consistent with
   sexual segregation but we reject the hypothesis that this is a outcome
   of indirect competition for food, because our concurrent studies on
   elephant feeding ecology found no evidence for intraspecific
   competition. Instead, we propose that most adult male elephants space
   themselves to avoid conflict with musth bulls and roam widely in the dry
   season between discretely distributed feeding `hotspots'. The small
   proportion of males that are in musth remain close to family units to
   maximize mating opportunities, and family units are unable to range far
   from water in the dry season. This is due to (1) comparatively high
   rates of water turn-over among juveniles and lactating cows and (2) the
   reduced mobility of neonates.},

Abstract = {Various models that assume correlations between maternal phenotype and
   offspring environment predict adaptive variation in egg size within
   populations. Here we conduct a comparative test of these models using
   published data on fish egg size. Intrapopulation variation in egg size
   was most pronounced in fish with demersal eggs and larvae (median
   coefficient of variation {[}CV] at family level = 6.5\%), where
   offspring environment is likely influenced by maternal phenotype, and
   least so in fish with pelagic eggs (CV = 3.6\%), which experience a
   relatively stochastic spatial distribution during incubation. This
   difference was significant at various taxonomic levels, was robust to
   variation in mean egg size and habitat (i.e., freshwater or marine), and
   was mirrored in independent paired contrasts. Fish with demersal eggs
   and pelagic larvae were not significantly different from those with
   pelagic eggs (CV = 3.8\%), indicating that selection favoring
   within-population variation in egg size occurs mainly posthatching and
   that any such selection occurring prehatching may be less intense. These
   results suggest that patterns of within-population variation in egg size
   among fish taxa reflect adaptive processes and that maternal effects on
   the egg size-fitness function may explain apparent discrepancies from
   the single-optima Smith-Fretwell model.},

Abstract = {Some of the highest recordings of radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl
   accident in Norway were found in the south-eastern Oppland and Hedmark
   counties. Cesium content and decay rates were followed in populations of
   brown trout and Arctic char in Lake Atnsjoen over the years 1986-1995.
   These results were compared with samples for adjacent lakes to test for
   between-lake variabilities within the same region. The data on brown
   trout was compared with samples from a wider region, where more than
   1800 individual samples of brown trout were collected from nearly 100
   localities. Back-calculated initial activity per 1 January 1987 showed a
   strong regional and within-lake variability for these localities,
   ranging from 437 to 18 000 Bq kg(-1) (average: 2416 Bq kg(-1)), while
   trout and char from Atnsjoen had initial activities of 1259 and 1122 Bq
   kg(-1), respectively. Most of the other populations from the Atna region
   also had initial activities below the average (around 2000 Bq kg(-1)).
   Ecological half-life for both brown trout and Artic char in lake
   Atnsjoen was close to 1.7 years (corresponding to a decay rate of 0.4
   year), which was consistently lower than the 2.5 years average for the
   entire lake data set. Decay constants from linear regressions of total
   decay over time ranged from 0.15 to 0.28. For trout populations, a
   positive correlation was found between initial load and decay constants.
   Although trout and char clearly differ in their diet, no consistent
   differences were recorded in initial activities or decay rates for these
   two species in the Atna area.},

Title = {Growth-rate variation in brown trout in small neighbouring streams:
   evidence for density-dependence?},

Abstract = {The within- and among-population variation in individual growth rate of
   brown trout Salmo trutta L. was studied in five small neighbouring
   streams (seven isolated populations) within a distance of 70 km in east
   Norway. Observed growth rate was only weakly correlated with predicted
   maximum growth rate based on laboratory models, and there was a
   significant interaction with site. A generalized linear model showed
   that growth rate was positively correlated with temperature, but also
   that growth rate decreased as the summer season progressed. This might
   indicate either a seasonal decline in food availability or appetite, or
   a change in energy allocation strategy. Growth rate decreased with
   increasing fish age, probably as an effect of sexual maturation of older
   fish, and differential allocation of protein and lipid among different
   size-groups of brown trout. After adjusting for variation in
   temperature, season, and fish mass, there was still significant
   among-site variation in growth rate. A significant part of this
   variation was due to variation in brown trout density and the presence
   or absence of Alpine bullhead Cottus poecilopus. Growth rate decreased
   with increasing brown trout density, and was lower in the presence than
   in the absence of Alpine bullhead after correcting for variation in
   brown trout density. This last result may indicate the presence of
   interspecific competition. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British

Title = {Effects of seed masting of bilberry, oak and spruce on sympatric

   (Apodemus sylvaticus) in southern Norway},

Abstract = {In southern Norway, population fluctuations of the herbivorous bank vole
   Clethrionomys glareolus and the granivorous wood mouse Apodemus
   sylvaticus were analysed in relation to mast seeding of bilberry
   Vaccinium myrtillus, sessile oak Quercus petraea and Norway spruce Picea
   abies. Bilberries ripen in August, acorns are dispersed in September,
   whereas spruce seeds are usually dispersed during winter or spring. The
   bilberry index of both the current and previous year contributed
   significantly to explain the population growth indices of bank vole. The
   spruce seed index significantly influenced only the bank vole, whereas
   the acorn index significantly influenced only the wood mouse, apparently
   through increased winter survival. Because of the lack of significant
   responses to bilberry masting by granivorous wood mice, we conclude that
   the most likely explanation for the observed peak populations of bank
   voles in post-mast years of bilberry is that high seed crops have a
   positive influence on the chemical composition of bilberry plants, which
   are important as food for bank voles during winter.},

Abstract = {Counts of reproductive units, i.e. family groups, constitute the main
   monitoring index for lynx Lynx lynx populations in Scandinavia. However,
   for some purposes it is necessary to extrapolate from the number of
   family groups to obtain an estimate of total population size. Using data
   on survival and reproduction from radio-marked lynx from three
   Scandinavian study areas, we simulated the lynx population structure in
   February. The average proportions of family groups out of all
   independent individuals, i.e. adults and yearlings, in these simulations
   were 21\% +/- 2.1 (SD), 22\% +/- 3.6 and 27\% +/- 3.1 for the data sets
   from northern Sweden (Sarek), southeastern Norway (Hedmark) and
   south-central Sweden (Bergslagen), respectively, and the overall mean
   for all three study areas was 23\% +/- 3.8. This translated into
   extrapolation factors of 6.14 +/- 0.44, 6.24 +/- 0.73 and 5.48 +/- 0.40
   for the three study areas, respectively, leading to an overall mean for
   all three study areas of 5.95 +/- 0.64. We conclude, that it is possible
   to extrapolate from the number of family groups to obtain an estimate of
   total lynx population size with a statistical measure of uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Selection against large eggs has been proposed for aquatic environments,
   putatively because large eggs should have more difficulty obtaining the
   required oxygen. Here, we use brown trout (Salmo trutta) eggs to provide
   an experimental test of this hypothesis. At high levels of dissolved
   oxygen (14 ing l(-1)), egg survival was high and independent of egg
   size. At low oxygen levels (2.3 ing l(-1)), survival decreased overall,
   and was higher for large-egged than small-egged siblings. Thus, contrary
   to conventional expectation, low oxygen levels selected for large rather
   than small eggs. A second experiment using Atlantic salmon (S. salar)
   eggs indicated that oxygen consumption increases relatively slowly with
   increasing egg mass (allometric constant = 0.44). The failure of the
   conventional `bigger is worse during incubation' hypothesis may thus be
   due to the erroneous assumption that oxygen consumption increases at a
   greater rate with increasing egg mass than does the egg surface area
   that is available for oxygen diffusion. We also demonstrate, using data
   from Atlantic salmon, that nest-specific oxygen consumption decreases
   with increasing egg size, but that this effect is more pronounced for
   large than for small females. This may help to explain the positive
   correlation between adult body size and egg size observed in fishes that
   cluster their eggs.},

Title = {The impact of gastrointestinal nematodes on wild reindeer: experimental
   and cross-sectional studies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {1. It is well known that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a
   significant impact on the growth of farmed ruminants. The clinical signs
   of these parasites are often subtle, with production losses mainly due
   to reductions in host appetite and gut function. However, little is
   known about the impact of this widespread group of parasites on wild
   ruminants. We use experiments and cross-sectional data to investigate
   the effects of gastrointestinal nematodes on a wild host, the Svalbard
   reindeer.
   2. Individually marked reindeer were treated for parasites. Their body
   mass, back fat depth and fecundity were compared with the control group
   one year later. The effect of treatment on worm burdens was investigated
   in a subsample of animals that were culled 3 and 6 months after
   treatment. Also, the relationship between the intensity of infection and
   body mass, back fat depth and host pregnancy rates was investigated in
   cross-sectional data from culled reindeer.
   3. The anthelmintic treatment caused an increase in the body mass, back
   fat depth and fecundity of the reindeer. Treatment depressed the
   abundance of adult parasites of Ostertagia gruehneri for at least 6
   months, but had no significant effect on the abundance of adults of the
   other dominant parasite species, Marshallagi marshalli, or the abundance
   of larval stages of either species.
   4. In the cross-sectional study, the probability of a reindeer being
   pregnant in late winter was negatively related to the abundance of adult
   O. gruehneri when controlling for host body mass. However, no clear
   evidence were found for an effect of parasitism on host condition in the
   cross-sectional study.
   5. Our experimental results show for the first time in a natural
   ruminant host population that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a
   significant effect on host condition and fecundity. However, effects of
   infection on host condition was not detectable in the cross-sectional
   study. Also, we show that the experimental effects on host condition and
   fecundity is most likely to be due to a negative effect of O. gruehneri,
   while the experimental design did not allow detection of potential
   negative effects of M. marshalli.},

Abstract = {The kelp Laminaria hyperborea provides a habitat for a diverse
   invertebrate community. Invertebrate abundance is particularly high in
   the kelp holdfasts and associated with epiphytes on the stipes. We
   investigated colonisation patterns of this fauna on artificial substrata
   (holdfast and epiphyte mimics) exposed for short time periods in the
   kelp forest in two seasons, summer and late autumn. Within 7 days, 99
   taxa common on natural kelp substratum colonised the artificial
   substrata in large numbers, demonstrating high mobility and indicating
   that there may be a rapid exchange of individuals and species among
   algae. Gastropods and amphipods were the most abundant colonisers. In
   summer, a specific ``epiphyte fauna{''} could be distinguished from a
   ``holdfast fauna{''}, and species associated with epiphytes were
   significantly more abundant on the artificial substrata. Colonisation
   was more rapid in summer than in late autumn, which may be related to
   animal population density. The high dispersal rate can facilitate the
   interaction with other communities and with higher trophic levels in the
   kelp-forest food web.},

Abstract = {1. Non-directional asymmetries (fluctuating asymmetry, FA) from
   bilateral symmetry in morphological traits have been used as an
   indicator of environmental stress and may become an important diagnostic
   tool in environmental sciences, such as ecotoxicology.
   2. In this study the relationship was examined between wing feather
   asymmetry, measured as the difference between the length of the third
   primary on the left and right wing, and blood concentration of selected
   persistent organochlorines (OCs) in Arctic breeding Glaucous Gulls
   (Larus hyperboreus , Gunnerus).
   3. There was a positive relationship between primary asymmetry and blood
   concentrations of two PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) congeners (P <
   0.05), oxychlordane (P < 0.05), DDE (p `p
   `-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) (P < 0.05), and especially HCB
   (hexachlorbenzene) (P < 0.001). At HCB levels above 30 ng g(-1) (wet
   mass) there was a 60\% probability that the birds had asymmetric wing
   feathers.
   4. This study indicated that the present levels of organochlorines in
   the European Arctic are stressors for Glaucous Gulls, and that asymmetry
   measurements of wing feathers may be used as an indicator of both
   exposure and effects of such contaminants. FA may also be a promising
   measurement for monitoring the early effects of organochlorine pollution
   on bird populations.},

Abstract = {1. For a long time, dioecious plants have been a model system for
   understanding the interactions between plants and herbivores.
   Differences in growth rate and, consequently, investment in defence
   between sexes may lead to skewed sex ratios due to differential
   herbivory.
   2. In this study we evaluated the applicability of this idea to polar
   willow (Salix polaris ), which in the study site, Svalbard, displays a
   female-biased sex ratio.
   3. Excluding reindeer for 3 years increased the abundance of male
   flowers in one of two vegetation types investigated. Growth rates
   differed only slightly between the sexes, with females investing more in
   inflorescences.
   4. The concentration of chemical defence compounds (phenolics and
   condensed tannins) did not differ between the sexes.
   5. On the basis of these findings, the idea that growth rate-dependent
   herbivory caused the unbalanced sex ratio in S. polaris has to be
   rejected. Possibly an interaction of niche differentiation between male
   and female willows, in combination with reindeer grazing, produced the
   observed female-biased sex ratio, but the mechanism remains unclear.},

   in fishing gear during the first three months after birth, but high
   incidental mortality prevailed during the first 8-10 mo. Gray seals
   dispersed more widely (mean distance: 120 km) than harbor seals (mean
   distance: 69 km). Both species dispersed most widely during the two
   first months after tagging. The maximum distance moved was 739 km for
   gray and 463 km for harbor seals. Strong fidelity for their place of
   birth was observed in adult gray seals during breeding season. No
   significant difference in incidental mortality was detected between the
   areas of tagging. However, for 37 harbor seals tagged in a 724 km(2)

Abstract = {Mainland populations of Arctic reindeer and caribou Rangifer tarandus
   often undergo extensive movements, whereas populations on islands tend
   to be isolated and sedentary. To characterize the genetic consequences
   of this difference, levels of genetic diversity and subdivision of
   Svalbard reindeer (R. t. platyrhynchus ) from two adjacent areas on
   Nordenskjioldland, Spitsbergen were estimated using data from up to 14
   microsatellites. The mean number of alleles per locus in Svalbard
   reindeer was 2.4 and mean expected heterozygosity per locus was 0.36.
   The latter value was significantly lower than in Canadian caribou and
   Norwegian reindeer but higher than in some other cervid species. Large
   samples of females (n = 743) and small samples of males (n = 38) from
   two sites approximate to 45 km apart showed genetic subdivision, which
   could be due to local population fluctuations or limited gene flow. To
   our knowledge, this is the first study to report significant
   differentiation at microsatellite loci in Rangifer at such short
   geographical distances. Neither population showed genetic evidence for
   recent population bottlenecks when loci unbiased with respect to
   heterozygosity were analysed. In contrast, false signals of a recent
   bottleneck were detected when loci upwardly biased with respect to
   heterozygosity were analysed. Thus, Svalbard reindeer appeared to
   conform to the paradigm of island populations made genetically
   depauperate by genetic drift.},

Abstract = {Avian incubation is often initiated before all eggs are laid. In
   altricial birds this has been proposed to facilitate brood reduction
   through asynchronous hatching. However, in precocial birds eggs normally
   hatch synchronously even if incubation has started before all eggs are
   laid. Patterns of incubation start may be the adaptive trait selected
   for both in altricial and precocial species. Several hypotheses have
   been proposed to explain the timing of incubation start in birds.
   Decreasing egg-size after incubation start may be adaptively related to
   an early incubation start, either to ensure synchronous hatching or to
   decrease fitness cost of late hatched eggs. We have measured individual
   body condition, egg size and start of incubation in common eider
   Somateria mollissima, a precocial sea-duck which does not feed during
   the incubation period. Females in poor body condition start to incubate
   earlier in the laying sequence than those in good body condition.
   Furthermore females in poor body condition lay smaller final eggs than
   females in good body condition. The laying of smaller eggs late in the
   sequence is therefore probably related to energetic or nutritional
   state. We propose that females in poor body condition start to incubate
   early to shorten the nest period in order to reduce their mass loss, but
   at the cost of reduced size and growth of the ducklings from the eggs
   laid after incubation start. Females in good body condition on the other
   hand postpone incubation start at the cost of a longer incubation period
   and a higher mass loss to the benefit of synchronized hatching and a
   higher survival of ducklings.},

Volume = {484},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Macrofauna secondary responses to controlled eutrophication within two
   MARICULT/MAST-III projects, EULIT and COMWEB, are compared. EULIT
   utilises a nutrient gradient established in eight hard bottom mesocosms,
   whereas the data from COMWEB originate from a whole-ecosystem study-the
   case of experimental nutrient addition to Hopavagen lagoon. In both
   systems, nutrient addition started in May 1998, after initial studies of
   the background macrofauna communities, thus allowing application of
   Before-After-Control-Impact-Pairs techniques (BACIP). The main
   objectives have been to investigate the macrofauna responses to
   eutrophication in littoral rocky shore ecosystems and to evaluate if
   similar responses could occur in mesocosm and `field' systems, despite
   their inherent differences. Apart from a distinct increase in numbers of
   Littorina littorea L. and some indications of increased abundance of the
   genus Jaera, no significant changes, caused by 2.5 years of nutrient
   addition, could be detected in the mesocosm fauna. It is interesting,
   however, that these two possibly stimulated animal groups have two
   things in common: (1) both belong to the rather few mobile taxa, which
   are not flushed out of the system through the mesocosm outlets, (2) both
   feed on microalgae and green algae in the upper littoral zone, i.e.,
   algal groups that have shown the clearest response to the nutrient
   addition. In Hopavagen, 1.5 years of nutrient addition only caused
   modest plant and animal responses in the rocky shore ecosystem, although
   there was a markedly increased settlement of Mytilus edulis L. at one
   lagoon site. This increase was probably due to elevated levels of
   digestible particles (increased phytoplankton production) caused by the
   nutrient addition. There were also some indications of increased
   production of filamentous algae at this same lagoon site. All in all,
   both studies demonstrate only minor responses to increased nutrient
   levels within the littoral community (both plants and animals). One
   explanation to this may be that longer time-scales are needed in order
   for clear-cut changes to occur. Several observations also indicate that
   wave exposure (significant in both systems) may largely modulate the
   impact of increased nutrient load on the structure of littoral
   communities. Another explanation is the high degree of stability among
   littoral macroalgae-dominated communities with internal biological
   regulation factors (like grazing) possibly being able to counteract
   effects.},

Abstract = {The response of rocky shore ecosystems to increased nutrient
   availability was examined in eight land-based mesocosms designed for
   hard-bottom littoral communities built at Marine Research Station
   Solbergstrand ( Norway). The average seawater volume in each basin was 9
   m(3) with an average water residence time of about 2 h. A tidal regime
   resembling that in the fjord was maintained in the basins, and waves
   were generated regularly. NH4NO3 and H3PO4, at a constant molar NP ratio
   of 16:1, was added into 6 basins at concentrations 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
   muM DIN above the background DIN concentration during 1 1/2 years. Two
   mesocosms were kept as control treatment. Marine communities were
   introduced into the basins two years prior to the start of nutrient
   dosage. The effects of nutrient enrichment were few and only marginal
   during the first year of nutrient addition, while some effects became
   more obvious during the second year. The growth rate of the periphyton
   and fast-growing macroalgae communities was stimulated by nutrient
   enrichment, while the response was less evident among the perennial
   fucoids. The structure of the macroalgal communities, however, did not
   change during 16 months' measurements. In contrast, growth on artificial
   rock substrates during the same period of time revealed intensive growth
   of the fast-growing Ulva lactuca in high-dosed basins compared with
   low-dosed and control basins, which were dominated by the fucoid Fucus
   serratus. The fauna communities exhibited only a minor response to
   nutrient treatment. The common periwinkle Littorina littorea, however,
   appeared with increased abundance in the high-dosed basins. The total
   system metabolism tended to increase slightly, but not significantly,
   with increased nutrient loading.},

   during the spawning period could be used to indicate where spawning had
   taken place. Some fish left the river shortly after release, but 77\% of
   the fish stayed in the river during the spawning period in October. Most
   of the females (74\%) spawned in the river, including multi-sea winter
   salmon of approximately 10 kg. Some fish remained at the site of the
   release, while others migrated downstream to hiding places where they
   stayed until spawning. Long distance upstream migrations were not
   observed. The observations of the fish during the spawning period were
   used to identify spawning areas. Electrofishing for salmon fry in the
   spawning areas the following year in all cases produced fry, and in two
   of the years salmon fry were also found in areas where no spawning
   activity had been registered. Radio-tracking was an efficient method for
   determining whether transplanted salmon would remain in a `new `n river
   during the spawning season and for locating spawning areas, particularly
   when the fish were tracked daily.},

Abstract = {Surgical implantation has become a well-established method for attaching
   telemetry transmitters in studies of fish behaviour. However, a rather
   large number of reports of transmitter expulsion, fish mortality and
   adverse effects on fish physiology or behaviour, suggests that
   refinement and evaluation of the methods is needed, especially when
   tagging fish species for which no protocol has ever been assayed. This
   paper summarizes the authors' own experiences with telemetry transmitter
   implantation, primarily from field studies involving numerous species of
   fish. Where appropriate, results from existing literature are summarized
   and discussed. The paper focuses on how choice of surgical procedure,
   fish size, morphology, behaviour and environmental conditions can affect
   the success of telemetry transmitter implantation in fish.},

Abstract = {The value of marine reserves to protect threatened and vulnerable
   species, such as the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), is often
   uncertain because of a lack of knowledge about their ecology and habitat
   utilisation. To address this issue, a Wireless Communication System for
   location-based positioning of fish tagged with coded acoustic
   transmitters was installed to determine site fidelity of juvenile dusky
   groupers (mean total length = 30.4 cm, range: 20.5-40.0 cm; mean total
   weight = 470 g, range: 113-950 g) within a marine reserve (Island of
   Ustica, Sicily, Italy). The system was based on five wireless
   hydrophones distributed approximately 200 m apart along the coastline of
   the reserve, each monitoring acoustic signals from transmitters within a
   reception cell. The hydrophones retransmitted detected signals as a
   radio signal to a land-based receiver and data logger. Unique
   identifiers for each hydrophone permitted the identification of the
   detection cell containing the tagged fish. The wireless hydrophones had
   partly overlapping detection ranges, dividing the marine reserve into
   more than five different detection cells. The average detection range
   was 232 m, but coverage varied from site to site and with time,
   depending on many factors, such as ambient noise, wave action and signal
   strength of the transmitters. Despite some limitations, the Wireless
   Hydrophone System (WHS) combined with manual tracking provided a
   valuable tool for investigating site fidelity in the dusky grouper.
   Preliminary home ranges for the fish were estimated by the kernel method
   (probability level of 95\%), based on a limited set of manual tracking
   data, to be a median 5312 m(2) (range 1673-18 626 m(2)).},

Abstract = {Overhunting reduced Eurasian Beaver (Castor fiber) populations to c.
   1200 animals, in eight isolated populations, around the end of the 19th
   century. Protection, natural spread and reintroductions led to a
   powerful recovery in both range and populations during the 20th century,
   which continues at a rapid pace. The minimum population estimate is 593
   000. There are also c . 12 500 North American Beaver (C. canadensis)
   established in Finland and Russian Karelia; however, other populations
   of C. canadensis introduced in Austria, Poland and France ap-pear to be
   extinct. Castor fiber is now established throughout Europe with the
   exception of the British Isles, Iberia, Italy and the southern Balkans;
   reintroductions are continuing. Considerable further expansion in range
   and population, especially in western Europe and the lower Danube basin,
   can be expected. If current trends continue, C. fiber will, within a few
   decades, be a fairly common mammal in much of Europe. Following initial
   recolonization, populations typically show a pattern of rapid range
   extension within a watershed, followed only later by rapid population
   growth, and a barrier effect of watershed divides, which can be strongly
   isolating where physical or habitat barriers (such as mountains or
   intensive farmland) intrude between watersheds. Management of beaver
   distribution should therefore operate at the watershed scale, except
   where large human-made dams form significant bar-riers to spread. The
   period of rapid population increase, if unchecked, leads to a phase of
   population decline as marginal habitats are occupied and exhausted. This
   coincides with a peak in conflicts with human land-use interests. A
   regulated hunting take of healthy beaver populations is recommended as
   the optimal management regime in managed landscapes. Early provision of
   interpretation and public viewing opportunities has been a feature of
   several recent reintroductions. This provides a benefit to the local
   economy through wildlife tourism, and helps foster positive attitudes to
   beavers.},

Title = {Survival in fluctuating bank vole populations: seasonal and yearly

Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {98},

Abstract = {For most organisms, both within-year (i.e. seasonal) and between-year
   variations in demography are important components in shaping the
   population dynamic patterns observed on a multiannual scale. These two
   sources of variation have, however, rarely been studied simultaneously.
   Most of the recent work on small rodent population dynamics, for
   example, has focused on between-year variation. Densities of seed- and
   fruit-eating rodents, such as the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus),
   are in particular known to have between-year variation related to seed
   crop production. Here we report on the analysis of a long-term
   (1976-1982) capture-mark-recapture (CMR) study of the bank vole in
   Belgium. The study was done on two grids, an open and a fenced grid. As
   part of the CMR statistical analysis, we propose a general modelling
   approach which allows for a detailed understanding of the relative
   importance of seasonal and between-year variation in survival. We
   demonstrate that most of the seasonal variation corresponds to a lower
   apparent survival in spring compared to the rest of the year. During
   winter, apparent survival was lower on the open grid than on the fenced
   grid. Dispersal is therefore concluded to be an important determinant of
   the seasonal pattern. The between-year variation in survival is largely
   attributable to variation in seed crops, and is comparable in magnitude
   to the seasonal variation.},

Abstract = {Reproductive effort in female ungulates originates from gestation and
   lactation and has been studied extensively; however, no comparable
   studies of reproductive effort in males (due to fighting for access to
   mates) have, to our knowledge, previously been reported. Here, we report
   on weight loss of male red deer during the annual mating season-a direct
   measure of male reproductive effort (or somatic reproductive costs). The
   `terminal investment' hypothesis predicts that reproductive effort
   should increase with age, given that costs remain stable. We also
   propose the `mating strategy-effort' hypothesis, which predicts that
   reproductive effort peaks in prime-aged males, since they are most often
   the harem holders. Consistent with the mating strategy-effort
   hypothesis, relative weight loss during the rutting season peaked at
   prime age and was lower in younger and senescent males. Weight loss
   during the rut was relatively smaller as density increased and more so
   for older males. This is probably primarily due to males (particularly
   senescent males) starting their rut in poorer condition at high density.
   The pattern of reproductive effort in males with regard to age and
   density therefore differs markedly from the pattern reported for
   females.},

Abstract = {Even though theoretical models show that parasites may regulate host
   population densities, few empirical studies have given support to this
   hypothesis. We present experimental and observational evidence for a
   host-parasite interaction where the parasite has sufficient impact on
   host population dynamics for regulation to occur. During a six year
   study of the Svalbard reindeer and its parasitic gastrointestinal
   nematode Ostertagia gruehneri we found that anthelminthic treatment in
   April-May increased the probability of a reindeer having a calf in the
   next year, compared with untreated controls. However, treatment did not
   influence the over-winter survival of the reindeer. The annual variation
   in the degree to which parasites depressed fecundity was positively
   related to the abundance of O. gruehneri infection the previous October,
   which in turn was related to host density two years earlier. In addition
   to the treatment effect, there was a strong negative effect of winter
   precipitation on the probability of female reindeer having a calf. A
   simple matrix model was parameterized using estimates from our
   experimental and observational data. This model shows that the
   parasite-mediated effect on fecundity was sufficient to regulate
   reindeer densities around observed host densities.},

   mechanisms resulting in these patterns are addressed in the paper. Low
   seed rain density, lack of safe sites caused by microclimatic variation,
   low surface substrate moisture, and low soil nutrient availability may
   limit the density of the tree species. Tree growth may be limited by a
   short growing season and further diminished, by shoot and root damage
   reducing carbon and nutrient stores as well as by reducing carbon and
   nutrient uptake capacities. Positive and negative feedbacks of tree
   density on tree growth exist at treeline. Increased tree density leads
   to increased air temperature and decreased wind damage, but also to
   lower soil temperature, reduced nutrient availability, and greater
   nutrient competition.},

Title = {Effects of liming on aquatic macrophytes, with emphasis on Scandinavia},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {395-404},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The effects of liming on soft-water aquatic macrophytes are reviewed,
   based on data from the many limed lakes and rivers in Sweden and Norway.
   Liming usually leads to a re-establishment of acidification-sensitive
   species such as Fontinalis spp., Myriophyllum alterniflorum and
   Potamogeton spp. Most sensitive species have a critical level at pH ca.
   5.5, and are believed to depend on availability of HCO3- in the water.
   Some more or less acidophilic bryophytes, Nardia compressa and Sphagnum
   auriculatum coll. have declined, and usually die when directly exposed
   to lime deposits. Submerged Sphagnum mats have, however, in some cases
   increased temporarily after liming, probably due to an increased
   production Of CO2. The grammoid Juncus bulbosus (=J. supinus) showed a
   temporary massive expansion and nuisance growth in (over)limed lakes in
   SW Norway in the beginning of the 1990s. This extreme growth is
   explained by a combination of: (i) lime deposits on the sediments
   leading to mobilisation Of CO2 and NH4; and (ii) re-acidification of the
   water layer, promoting high levels Of CO2. In some lakes that have been
   limed for more than 10 years, M. alterniflorum has expanded
   considerably, reaching densities probably much higher than in the
   pre-acidification conditions. This situation is believed to be due to
   increased alkalinity and possibly due to eutrophication of the sediment.

Abstract = {Plants respond to herbivory either by maximizing resource acquisition
   and compensatory growth or by minimizing loss of resources, e.g.. by
   investing in chemical or structural defence. We studied the response to
   simulated browsing by the deciduous dwarf shrub, Salix polaris, on high
   Arctic Spitsbergen. Salix polaris is browsed by Svalbard reindeer, and
   its response to browsing may influence subsequent utilization. We
   compared leaf characteristics and flowering of S. polaris from areas
   with relatively short, intermediate, and long growing season, and their
   responses 1 yr after simulated browsing in early. mid, and late summer.
   Leaf numbers, total and individual biomass of leaves, and the number of
   inflorescences were greatly reduced the year after treatment, There was
   no increase in phenolics but a tendency to an increase in N content in
   the leases of S. polaris I yr after treatment. Salix polaris showed
   little variation in the response to simulated browsing) with local
   variation in resource availability (length of growing, time of browsing.
   The results suggest that S. polaris responds to summer browsing the
   previous year by allocating resources to compensatory growth rather than
   to defence. For reindeer, browsing of S. polaris leads to a sizeable
   decrease in food quantity and, possibly, to a limited increase in food
   quality.},

Abstract = {Selection programs for fish frequently target growth rate as a breeding
   goal, yet surprisingly little is known about which mechanisms underlying
   the growth process are being targeted. The aim of this study was thus to
   examine whether the process of artificial selection of Atlantic salmon
   (Salmo salar) that has resulted in higher growth rate resulted in
   underlying changes in the growth hormone (GH) - insulin-like growth
   factor I (IGF-I) axis of endocrine growth regulation. This was tested by
   comparing similarly reared seventh-generation farm salmon with wild
   salmon from the principal founder population of the farm strain at three
   life stages. Not unexpectedly, the domesticated fish outgrew their wild
   counterparts; this was most evident in salt water, where they averaged
   three times the weight by the end. Pituitary GH content was positively
   correlated with growth rate and correspondingly was significantly higher
   in the faster growing domesticated fish than in the wild fish. Plasma GH
   levels were also significantly higher in the domesticated fish, whereas
   IGF-I levels did not differ. These findings provide some of the first
   direct evidence indicating a link between domestication selection for
   growth and its endocrine regulation, whereby individuals with more
   active endocrine growth regulatory components are targeted.},

Abstract = {We explored the long-term effect of various management strategies for a
   mountain ungulate, the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). living in a mosaic
   of protected reserves and hunting areas. The chamois occurs in the
   French Alps at high densities within protected reserve,, but is heavily
   hunted in the surrounding areas, Extensive demographic studies were used
   for developing a model of the population in the reserve area, as well as
   for the hunting area. The chamois in the reserve has value for tourism
   and conservation. whereas the chamois outside the reserve has mainly
   hunting value. Optimal management of the overall system consisting of
   reserve and hunting areas depends on the management objective: either a
   simple maximization of the value of hunted chamois, or the value of
   hunted chamois together with the value of the chamois in the reserve. We
   explored how optimal harvesting strategies are affected by the relative
   hunting values of the sexes and the relative nonconsumptive values of
   the chamois inside the reserve. A male-biased, sex-specific harvesting
   rate was generally found to be optimal. a bias which was larger when the
   value of the chamois in the reserve was included. Movement rates and sex
   ratio play critical roles in such systems, and should therefore be
   studied more than they typically are. We suggest experimental approaches
   to test the critical parameters of the model.},

Title = {Testing for changes in community structure based on repeated sampling},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {83},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2271-2277},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {When comparing samples to evaluate changes in community structure, there
   are several uncertainties that must be taken into consideration.
   Sampling inevitably induces randomness in observed species composition
   and abundance. Even if they come from exactly the same community, two
   samples may show considerable differences. If the sampling effort
   varies, differences will increase even more. Finally, when time has
   elapsed between samples, we would like to correct for variations in true
   species abundance occurring naturally due to fluctuating environmental
   conditions. In this paper we develop a test method that corrects for
   sampling in general, as well as for differential sampling efforts. The
   species abundances are also allowed to vary in time, enabling us to test
   for additional changes in community structure due to some extraordinary
   event. The method will be useful when analyzing consequences of
   human-induced disturbances, such as pollution, but also natural
   catastrophes, such as fire, flooding, extreme weather, or arrival of new
   species. Here, our method will be applied to a pair of samples from an
   insect community. We found that the result was affected by the way we
   chose to measure the community structure, and that the conclusion
   depended heavily on the estimate of the environmental variation.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) toxicokinetics and hepatic P450 (CYP) 1A
   activities were studied in wild anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus

   returned from summer feeding in seawater and were held without food over
   winter. In September the fish were given a single, oral dose of either 0
   (control), 0.1, 1, or 50 mug PCB/g fish. During winter a net loss of PCB
   occurred from the carcass (including gut), whereas net inputs and
   increases in concentrations of PCB in the liver and brain occurred with
   increases in brain PCB concentrations being up to 10-fold. Hepatic CYP1A
   activities were positively correlated with the PCB dose in October, In
   the fish given I mg PCB/kg fish in September, however, a 12-fold
   increase in CYP1A activity occurred from October to May. This increase
   in CYP1A activity was observed during a period in which the body burden
   of PCB decreased by 20\%. These results demonstrate that interpretations
   of the CYP1A biomarker response must be made with caution. Overall, the
   findings point to potentiated risks of biological effects of PCB during

Title = {Migration of anadromous brown trout Salmo trutta in a Norwegian river},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {47},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1391-1401},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Upstream and downstream migrating anadromous brown trout Salmo trutta
   were monitored daily in fish traps in the River Imsa in south-western
   Norway for 24 years, from 1976 to 1999. One-third of the fish descended
   to sea during spring (February-June) and two-thirds during autumn
   (September-January).
   2. In spring, high water temperature appeared to influence the
   downstream descent. Large brown trout (> 30 cm, chiefly two or more sea
   sojourns) descended earlier and appeared less dependent on high water
   temperature than smaller and younger fish. The spring water flow was
   generally low and of little importance for the descent.
   3. In autumn, the daily number of descending brown trout correlated
   positively with flow and negatively with water temperature.
   4. Brown trout ascended from the sea between April and December, but
   more than 70\% ascended between August and October. The number of
   ascending trout increased significantly with both decreasing temperature
   and flow during the autumn. This response to flow appeared to be the
   result of the autumn discharge which is generally high and most fish
   ascended at an intermediate flow of 7.5-10 m(3) s(-1) (which is low for
   the season).
   5. In a river like the Imsa with low spring and high autumn flows, water
   temperature appears to be the main environmental factor influencing the
   timing and rate of spring descent, while both water temperature and flow
   seemed to influence the timing and rate of the autumn descent and
   ascent. These relationships make sea trout migrations susceptible to
   variation in climate and human impacts of the flow regime in rivers.},

Title = {Factors affecting the recruitment variability of the Norwegian

Abstract = {The Norwegian spring-spawning herring is characterized by large,
   long-term stock size variations. The main population dynamics mechanism
   explaining these fluctuations is variation in recruitment. The
   recruitment to the stock varies by nearly three orders of magnitude.
   This study examines recruitment variability of herring emphasizing
   environmental influences on the determination of year-class strength,
   and on environmental signals indicating recruitment strength, such as
   conditions for breeding seabird populations. The Atlantic puffin
   (Fratercula arctica) is an important top predator of 0-group herring and
   its colonies in northern Norway are strategically situated for that
   purpose. Results from a long-term population study of puffins are
   incorporated into the study. The year-class strength for the Norwegian
   spring-spawning herring is predominantly determined before most of the
   herring larvae have passed the puffin colonies, i.e. in July. The
   extremely good year-classes, such as 1983, 1991 and 1992, seem to be
   characterized by very low mortality north of the colonies, i.e. during
   July-August. Based on the mean temperature in the Barents Sea in January
   (prior to spawning), the number of high wind speed events off northern
   Norway in April and the fledging success of puffin, we can predict
   year-class strength of herring in July. (C) 2002 International Council

Abstract = {The pattern of intraclutch egg-size variation in barnacle goose (Branta
   leucopsis) clutches and its adaptive implications was studied in
   Svalbard, Norway, from 1989 to 1998. Egg size was measured in relation
   to laying sequence, egg predation and hatching order were recorded to
   determine hatching success of eggs in different laying sequences, and
   the time when incubation started was examined. Egg size showed a rather
   consistent pattern, with a large second-laid egg and declining egg size
   for the remainder of the clutch. The first-laid egg was usually smaller
   than the second one, except in clutches with two and three eggs.
   Predation was highest for the first-laid egg, and last-laid eggs hatched
   last in most cases, although only one last-laid egg was abandoned. Four
   of six females started incubation before clutch completion. Both the
   ``nutrient-allocation hypothesis{''} as well as the ``early incubation
   start hypothesis{''} may contribute to explaining the expressed pattern
   of intraclutch egg-size variation. The fitness gains due to allocating
   fewer nutrients to eggs in unfavourable positions in the laying sequence
   may explain the small size of the first egg, whereas the multiple
   benefits of an early incubation start may have led to the decline in egg
   size later in the laying sequence as a mechanism to counteract hatching
   asynchrony.},

Abstract = {The capacity for mothers to transmit induced resistance against a

   the exposure of birds to the tick vector Ixodes uriae . However, as yet,
   there has been no demonstration of a direct relationship between
   antibody concentrations in parents and young in a natural population.
   Here, we show, using the kittiwake-Borrelia system, the existence of a
   positive relationship between antibody concentrations in maternal serum
   and that in eggs and chick serum. No such relationship was found between
   paternal serum and eggs or young. These results suggest the existence of
   an adaptive maternal effect, an effect that should have important

Abstract = {The gastrointestinal nematode Ostertagia gruehneri is a parasite of
   reindeer that can have a significant impact on host population dynamics.
   To gain a better understanding of the population dynamics of O.
   gruehneri, we parameterise a model for its fecundity that descibes the
   observed seasonal and intensity dependent pattern of faecal egg counts
   well. The faecal egg count model is combined with a model for the
   seasonal faecal production rate of Svalbard reindeer to obtain
   quantitative estimates of the fecundity of O. gruehneri. The model is
   used to evaluate the relative contribution to pasture contamination of
   variation in the abundance of O. gruehneri and variation in reindeer
   densities. It is concluded that due to the intensity dependence in
   nematode fecundity, variation in reinder population densities is likely
   to be the most important of these factors for pasture contamination. (C)

Title = {Large-scale habitat variability, delayed density effects and red deer

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {1. Parallel to the large-scale changes in land-use patterns over the
   last century in Europe, many deer species have expanded their range and
   increased in density, but the role of habitat changes for their
   population ecology remains poorly documented.
   2. We tested for effects of variability in agricultural (proportion of
   meadow and density of sheep) and forestry practices (proportion of
   coniferous and deciduous forest) in 106 municipalities in Norway on body
   weight of 10 206 female and 15 499 male adult red deer collected over
   the period 1965-2000.
   3. Long-term temporal changes in body weights may also be due to delayed
   density effects, either due to that persistent high density of red deer
   through grazing and browsing may affect vegetation composition (i.e. an
   effect of cumulative density after present-day density is controlled
   for), or that individuals born at high density start to penetrate the
   population (cohort-effects). As these effects may be confounding to
   variability in forestry or agricultural practice, we also test whether
   cohort and/or cumulative density may affect body weight of red deer.
   4. There was a strong negative effect of cohort density, but no effect
   of cumulative density in the previous 10 years once the cohort effect
   was accounted for.
   5. There was a clear positive effect of proportion of meadow on red deer
   body weight, while there was no effect of sheep density once the effect
   of proportion of meadow was adjusted for. Proportion of meadow increased
   during the study, but most of the variation was between municipalities
   (i.e. in space).
   6. Neither proportional area of coniferous or deciduous forest
   consistently affected body weight of red deer in Norway.
   7. Our study emphasizes the multitude of factors over time and space
   that affects body weight, and hence demography and population dynamics,
   of large herbivores.},

Abstract = {Integrated effects of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and nutritional
   status on responses to handling disturbance were investigated in the
   Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). The fish were orally contaminated
   with Aroclor 1254 and held either with or without food for 5 months
   before they were subjected to a 10-min handling disturbance.
   Food-deprived fish were given 0, 1, 10 or 100 mg PCB kg(-1) and the fed
   fish 0 or 100 mg PCB kg(-1). Plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate levels
   were measured at 0 (pre-handling), 1, 3, 6 and 23 h after the handling
   disturbance. Food-deprived control fish had elevated plasma cortisol
   levels compared with fed fish before handling. These basal cortisol
   levels were suppressed by PCB in food-deprived fish, and elevated by PCB
   in fed fish. The immediate cortisol and glucose responses to handling
   disturbance were suppressed by PCB in a dose-dependent way in
   food-deprived fish. Although these responses were also lowered by PCB in
   the fed fish, the effect was much less pronounced than in food-deprived
   fish. There were only minor effects on plasma lactate responses. Our
   findings suggest that the stress responses of the Arctic charr are
   compromised by PCB and that the long-term fasting, typical of
   high-latitude fish, makes these species particularly sensitive to
   organochlorines such as PCB. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Between 1984 and 1989, the experimental removal of 31 tons (666000 fish)
   of stunted Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, from Takvatn in northern
   Norway, had strong effects on the populations of Arctic charr, brown
   trout, Salmo trutta, and three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus
   aculeatus. The littoral catch per unit effort (CPUE) of charr had
   decreased by 90\% in 1990 and then increased to about 50\% of the
   initial level by 1994 while the pelagic CPUE had decreased to zero.
   Growth in both charr and trout greatly improved when the charr density
   had decreased, and large fish of both species appeared in the catches.
   These large fish became predators on small charr in the littoral zone.
   The incidence of trout increased from below 1\% to 15\% from 1988 to
   1999 after a brief peak at 30\% in 1992 and 1993. The charr population
   attained a bimodal size distribution and did not return to the stunted
   state during the 10 years following the intensive fishing period. The
   mass removal experiment showed that it is possible to change the
   structure of a charr population by intensive fishing. Predation on small
   charr from cannibals and large trout was probably essential for
   maintaining the new population structure. An increase in the growth of
   young charr from 1995 to 1997 was related to a high consumption of
   Daphnia and Eurycercus. Rapid changes in the growth of charr followed
   the density fluctuations in sticklebacks, which show large annual
   variations in this system; the rapid changes in charr growth were
   probably caused by variations in the competition intensity for
   cladoceran prey between young charr and sticklebacks. Twenty years of
   data has provided important information, but even more time is needed to
   follow the long-term trends in northern lakes such as Takvatn.},

Abstract = {The circumpolar Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, is ideal for studying
   how environmental factors affect life history in fishes. Charr
   populations demonstrate a tremendous ecological plasticity and
   adaptations to harsh environments. Arctic charr is the only freshwater
   fish on Svalbard, including anadromous, resident, and landlocked stocks.
   Freshwater lake systems on Svalbard are characterized by very low water
   temperatures, long-term or even permanent ice cover, and low levels of
   nutrients. Food is thus limited and may lead to growth stagnation and
   early maturity in Arctic charr. The individual growth pattern may
   alternatively follow a sigmoid-shaped curve, caused by a shift to either
   cannibalistic or anadromous (migration to sea) behaviour. In lake
   systems that include migratory charr, the population may consist of a
   mixture of parr, postsmolt, and adult migratory individuals, as well as
   small-sized resident, large-sized resident (cannibals), and large
   formerly resident individuals transformed to anadromy. Our study in the
   Lake Dieset watercourse (79degreesN), Svalbard, demonstrates that the
   annual water flow in the outlet river is strongly correlated to air
   temperatures and provides a passage to the sea, allowing the chart
   access to the nutrient-rich seawater environment, during at most two
   months each year. During one of the years studied, the youngest and
   small-sized part of the sea-going stock was prevented from ascending the
   river and probably suffered mortality during winter. The migratory
   window of the Arctic charr in Lake Dieset is therefore highly variable
   among years and thus unpredictable. We hypothesize that in worst case
   scenarios (cold years, low water discharge), climatic variations may
   occasionally prevent charr from migrating upstream in Svalbard lake
   systems in late autumn, resulting in high mortality in the population.},

Abstract = {Seasonal changes in hypoosmoregulatory capacity were studied in
   hatchery-reared offspring of a high-Arctic strain of anadromous Arctic
   charr, Salvelinus alpinus, from Svalbard (79degreesN) and a sub-Arctic
   strain from Hammerfest, north Norway (70degreesN). The fish were held in
   freshwater under simulated, natural light conditions (Tromso,
   69degreesN) and natural water temperatures, and hypoosmoregulatory
   capacity was determined by seawater challenge tests between February and
   November. An improved hypoosmoregulatory capacity was seen in both
   strains at the time when their wild conspecifics migrate to the sea. The
   time when maximum hypoosmoregulatory capacity was achieved differed
   significantly between the two strains, suggesting that there may be
   genetic differences between the two populations in how environmental
   cues (e.g. temperature, photoperiod) entrain the development of seawater
   tolerance. The development and loss of hypoosmoregulatory capacity
   seemed to be more rapid and abrupt in the Svalbard charr than in the
   Hammerfest charr. This is hypothesised to be an adaptation to the
   stochastic and unpredictable variations in the time when the fish are
   allowed to migrate in the high-Arctic, and the need to prevent migration
   in years when the ice break occurs very late.},

   rate and survival were analysed. Vlalpha-tagged and untagged control
   fish had similar growth rates and grew significantly faster than
   Floy-tagged fish during the experiment. Tag retention was significantly
   higher for Floy tags (94\%) than for VIalpha tags (78\%). Most VIalpha
   tag loss (11\%) took place within the first 10 days of tagging while
   there were no Floy tags lost during this period. Survival rates were

Abstract = {Fish tagging methods are important tools in the research and management
   of salmonids; the Carlin tag is widely used, especially in anadromous
   salmonids. However, this tagging method may interfere with fish
   behaviour and increase post-smolt mortality. To estimate
   Carlin-tag-inflicted mortality in Arctic charr, We used jet injection of
   alcian blue (colour tags) as a control. Recapture rates were higher for
   the colour-tagged fish than for the Carlin-tagged fish for both one- and
   two-year-old smolts. For one-year-old smolts in 1992, the recapture rate
   was 18.9\% for colour-tagged fish and 10.0\% for Carlin-tagged ones. For
   two-year-old smolts in the same year, 34.0\% of colour- and 28.6\% of
   Carlin-tagged fish were recaptured; in 1993, recapture rates were 17.2\%
   and 6.3\% for colour- and Carlin-tagged fish, respectively.
   Colour-tagged one-year-old Arctic charr also grew faster than their
   Carlin-tagged counterparts. No differences in growth rates were found
   between tagging methods in two-year-olds. These results imply that for
   hatchery-reared Arctic charr, survival rates using Carlin tagging may be
   half to one third that of colour tagging. Growth was also higher among
   colour-tagged fish, indicating that Carlin tags alter the behaviour of
   fish in the sea.},

Abstract = {Recruitment rate has declined in many Norwegian moose Alces alces
   populations during the last two decades and at the same time the
   population size has increased and the proportion of males to females has
   decreased. Although density-dependent food limitation may explain part
   of the decrease in productivity, we evaluated to what extent the decline
   could also be a result of an insufficient number of males in the
   populations to fertilise all females. To test this hypothesis, we
   compared, based on ovary analyses, the age-specific variation in
   fecundity rates in eight Norwegian moose populations with annual
   variation in the adult sex ratio. Differences in female age and body
   mass explained a significant proportion of the variance in the
   probability of pregnancy. In addition, there was a significant
   relationship between the population sex ratio and the probability of
   pregnancy among 2-year-old females, but not the probability of pregnancy
   of older females. Because biased sex ratio only affects first-time
   breeders, the effect on the population recruitment rate may be limited.
   However, we also call attention to other possible effects of biased sex
   ratio, e.g. delayed parturition date, which in the long term may
   decrease population productivity through effects on survival and
   fecundity.},

Abstract = {The content of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants was determined
   in a total of 44 egg samples from 8 different raptor species collected
   throughout Norway in the period 1991-1997. The content of 8 chlorinated
   bornanes, 9 chlorinated pesticides, and 15 polychlorinated biphenyl
   congeners (PCB) were determined. The highest average concentrations for
   PCB were found for eggs from White-tailed Sea Eagle and Peregrine Falcon
   (average Sum PCB concentration: 8.9 and 9.1 mug/g wet weight (w.w.),
   respectively). Merlin and Sparrowhawk eggs were the highest contaminated
   with chlorinated pesticides (average sum pesticide concentration: 3.0
   and 4.3 mug/g w.w.). For the first time, the content of chlorobornanes
   was determined in Norwegian birds of prey eggs. However, only minor
   contamination compared to PCBs and conventional chlorinated pesticides
   was found. The highest Sum concentration was determined for White-tailed
   Sea Eagle eggs (0.09 mug/g w.w.). No chlorobornane contamination was
   found in Osprey and Merlin eggs. No spatial and regional specific trends
   or pattern distribution were found for organochlorine contamination in
   the egg samples analysed. In order to gain information about enantiomer
   specific bioaccumulation and biotransformation capacity of the organism,
   enantioselective analyses was performed for the chiral contaminants
   trans-chlordane, oxy-chlordane and the chlorobornane B9-1679 (Parlar
   \#50). indications for species-dependent deviation from the racemic
   distribution (enantiomeric ratio = 1) were found. Peregrine Falcon and
   Merlin eggs were characterised with an extremely high enantiomeric
   excess of the (-)-trans-chlordane (enantiomeric ratio (ER) < 0.01). For
   Golden Eagle, Goshawk and Sparrowhawk eggs, the ERs were between 0.1 and
   0.22 demonstrating also here that the (-)-trans-chlordane was the most
   abundant enantiomer. For the distribution of oxy-chlordane and B9-1679
   enantiomers no species-dependent differences were found. For all species
   the ER values between 0.3 and 0.8 were determined. Thus, also for
   oxy-chlordane and B9-1679, the (-)-enantiomers are the most dominating
   stereoisomers in the birds of prey eggs analysed. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {A central theme in life history theory is to determine how reproduction
   varies with age in iteroparous organisms. Evidence of ageing and
   senescence, defined as the progressive loss of function accompanied by
   decreased performance with age, remains poorly documented for large
   herbivores, in particular as it relates to reproduction. Analyses of
   body weight of 87 532 domestic sheep lambs demonstrates that onset of
   reproductive senescence in ewes occurs already at 5 and 6 years of age
   when measured, respectively, as lamb weight and litter size produced.
   This provides convincing evidence of early onset of reproductive
   senescence in this highly domesticated sheep breed. As this is earlier
   than indicated for other Ovis species as well as for the Soay sheep, an
   ancient and lightly domesticated sheep, we hypothesize that there may be
   a cost of selection for large litter size in mammalian herbivores.},

Abstract = {1. Data on the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is commonly used
   in risk assessments of the possible impact of oil spills. The validity
   of such assessments depends on the stability of the observed spatial
   pattern through time. In this study we explored the year-to-year
   predictability in the spatial distribution of guillemots (Uria spp.)
   from a 9-year data set covering an area of approximately 1000 x 600
   km(2) in the Barents Sea from late January to early March.
   2. Spatial correlograms were used to elucidate the strength and scale of
   the spatial patterns within years, and the concordance of these patterns
   between years. Broad-scale oceanographic features were used in linear
   regressions to model the spatial pattern in guillemot distribution for
   each year. The ability of these models to predict their spatial
   distribution in other years was then evaluated.
   3. The analyses revealed two nested levels of patchiness. The
   large-scale pattern, with a characteristic scale of 300 km, had a weak
   (R-2 = 0.06) but significant spatial predictability between years. The
   predictability increased marginally when the data set was divided into
   two time periods (R-2 equal to 0.07 and 0.17, respectively). Nested
   within the large-scale pattern, the analyses revealed a small-scale
   level of patchiness with no significant spatial year-to-year
   predictability.
   4. The broad-scale oceanographic variables could explain from 14\% to
   42\% of the variance in the spatial distribution of guillemots within
   each year. The models were on average significantly better than using a
   random model when predicting other years. We found no relationships
   between the fit of the models and the ability to predict guillemot
   distribution in other years. There was a large variation in the
   parameter estimates between years, resulting in a large range in
   predicted values.
   5. This study illustrates some of the difficulties associated with
   predicting the spatial distribution of mobile and patchy organisms. Our
   results indicate that the use of restricted survey data in extrapolating
   and predicting the distribution of seabirds may be misleading.
   Restricted survey data should mainly be used to identify vulnerable
   populations on a regional scale. Only when larger data series are
   available is it possible to evaluate, quantify and model the predictable
   spatial pattern in more detailed assessment analyses. There is a need to
   develop methods that quantify how unpredictable patchiness may affect
   the vulnerability of populations to surface pollutants and other
   environmental disturbances.},

Abstract = {We studied the summer home range and habitat selection of harbor seal
   pups tracked using VHF radio telemetry along the coast of central
   Nor-way in 1997 and 1998. Median fixed kernel home range of six pups
   tracked in 1998 was 10.4 km(2) and the median core area was 1.2 km(2).
   One particular deep basin (>100 m deep) was highly selected, and
   extensively used by four of the pups, probably for feeding. An area
   adjacent to the deep basin also was selected, probably for haul outs.
   One pup spent most of the time in inshore, kelp forest areas. Shallow
   areas without kelp forest and exposed land were used least frequently,
   possibly because they did riot provide suitable areas for feeding and to
   haul out. The seals hauled out more during calm wind and low tide than
   during rough wind and high tide. Seals seemed to haul out on interticlal
   rocks associated with islands, and alternated between several haul-out
   sites. We found no pattern in haul-out activity associated with age,
   time of day, air/sea temperature, cloud cover, or rainfall. In 1997,
   seven pups were tracked manually. These data were associated with
   methodological limitations, and they were used only to illustrate that
   these seals stayed mainly within the shallow, inshore, kelp forest area,
   indicating a possible difference in habitat use between years.},

Abstract = {Why do group differences in landscape assessment exist? In the present
   paper, we explore the hypothesis that landscape preferences are
   associated with people's environmental value orientations,
   operationalised according to Thompson and Barton's {[}J. Environ,
   Psychol. 14 (1994) 199] distinctions between anthropocentric,
   ecocentric, and apathetic orientations toward the environment.
   Preferences for local landscapes and environmental value orientations
   were surveyed in a sample of the adult population of Roros, southern
   Norway. The highest preference was expressed for wildland scenes
   containing water, followed by cultural landscapes and traditional farm
   environments. Landscapes with elements of modern agricultural practises
   were the least preferred category. Significant positive correlations
   were found between the ecocentric environmental value orientation and a
   preference for wildlands with water, and for cultural landscapes. The
   anthropocentric value orientation correlated positively with a
   preference for farm environments, while environmental apathy was
   negatively associated with a preference for wildlands and cultural
   landscapes. The respondents agreed to ecocentric, but were neutral to
   anthropocentric statements. The findings indicate that the majority of
   the people in the area should be responsive to ecocentric arguments when
   development and conservation plans are presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Post-hatch brood amalgamation is common in many waterfowl species and
   especially prevalent in the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima). Studies
   in the temperate region have shown that brood abandonment is influenced

   how these two factors influenced the probability of brood desertion in
   ciders breeding under harsh conditions in the high Arctic (78degreesN).
   We found that females in poor body condition were less likely, to care
   for their young, but there was no effects of brood size. We speculate
   that the differences between southern and northern populations of ciders
   may be due to different environmental conditions. Received 10 October

Abstract = {Many hypotheses have been raised to try explaining the failure of
   Fennoscandian arctic fox Alopex lagopus populations to recover following
   60-70 years of protection. One of the most appealing hypotheses has been
   that they depend on scavenging the kills of ungulates made by large
   carnivores, mainly wolves Canis lupus, which have been absent for much
   of the 20th century. We examine this hypothesis using a variety of data
   from throughout the holarctic range of arctic foxes and conclude that
   there is little evidence for the importance of this food source -
   although it is an issue that needs to be examined in greater detail.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of the small mammal cycle in
   Fennoscandia have led to two main conclusions: a south-north
   geographical gradient in the strength of density dependence and period
   length, and a change in temporal dynamics with less clear periodicity
   and lower amplitude of fluctuations in recent years. Fourteen years
   (1985-1998) of small mammals trapping and Tengmalm's owls monitoring
   data provided clear evidence for 3-yr cycles of two vote species in
   inner Troms, north Norway, at the same latitude and only 80 km from
   Kilpisjarvi, north Finland, where 4-5-yr cycles have been the norm until
   the end of 1980s. The response of Tengmalm's owls to variation in small
   rodents abundance was not delayed, as was observed in central Finland.
   Common shrews appeared to have more stable dynamics. The features of the
   cycle, and a reassessment of the previously described patterns, show
   that the dynamics may be different over short distances. Furthermore,
   snow cover and habitat fragmentation should explicitly be taken into
   account in any understanding of the Fermoscandian gradient, and
   surrogate variables such as latitude should be avoided. We stress the
   need for a more extensive coverage of spatial and temporal patterns in
   cyclicity with respect to assumed ecological causes.},

Abstract = {One important question in ecology is how large-scale regional phenomena
   affect the demography and dynamics of local populations. The purpose of
   the present study was to examine how climate affected spatial and
   temporal variation in demography within an insular metapopulation of
   House Sparrows (Passer domesticus). Daily weather conditions during the
   breeding season were highly correlated within the study region, and
   because the onset of breeding differed significantly among the five
   study islands, fledgling success was also affected. Thus, local
   recruitment was reduced by the occurrence of bad weather during the
   nestling period, and the asynchronous breeding phenology among the
   islands led to a significant island X year interaction in recruitment
   rate. Interaction between climate and the local environment provides a
   mechanism by which spatial synchrony in population dynamics can be
   reduced even in strongly spatially autocorrelated environments.},

Abstract = {A 1680 km(2) coastal archipelago area in Norway around Sandoy
   (62degreesN 6degreesE), with a resident population of approximately 750
   harbour seals was modelled in a geographic information system (GIS). The
   proportions of different habitat types available to harbour seals for
   foraging were estimated. Empirical data on levels of activity and
   foraging of VHF radio-tracked harbour seals were used to parameterise an
   energetics simulation model based on activity, body size, and
   composition. The harbour-seal energy requirement was simulated for a
   period from 20 June to 31 August. The diet of seals in the area was
   established from otoliths in faecal samples. The daily food requirements
   of the 750 harbour seals averaged 3 t based on a diet of mainly Gadidae.
   A procedure to extrapolate from individual movements and foraging
   activities of radio-tracked seals to population-level habitat use of
   foraging seals was adopted. The habitat use of the population was then
   used to integrate the results of the energetics simulations into the;
   GIS model. The distribution of fishing operations was included and the
   co-occurrence of fishing operations and seals was analysed. The largest
   potential for interaction between fisheries and harbour seals was a
   bottom-set gillnet fishery at 100-200-m depth just off the slope
   separating the archipelago and adjacent shelf waters. Seals were
   foraging on fish species targeted by this fishery and the entanglement
   of seals in this type of fishery was assumed to have an effect both on
   seal population growth rate and on gillnet fishing efficiency. An
   estimated total of 32.1 t of fish was removed by seal predation from the
   areas actually fished by bottom-set nets (117 km(2)) during the 73 days
   simulation period. The corresponding figures for the areas fished by
   Danish seine (140 km(2)) and shrimp trawl (153 km(2)) were 20.4 and 40.6
   t of Fish, respectively. While sail predation of fish probably caused
   negative effects on gillnet and Danish seine catches the removal of
   benthic-feeding fishes may cause a positive effect on shrimp catches.

Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-57},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A model is presented of the annual consumption of prey by seabirds
   living in the Norwegian and Barents seas (ICES Areas I, IIa, and IIb)
   based on the numbers of birds present at any one time, their energy
   expenditure (and hence their food demand), and the composition of their
   diet. About 20 million seabirds living in the Barents Sea annually
   consume approximately 1.16 x 10(6) t, with Brunnich's guillemots (Uria
   lomvia) taking around 550 000 t (or 47\% of the total). Of the total
   harvest in the Barents Sea, fatty fish constitutes 45\% and
   invertebrates 46\%. Annual consumption in the Norwegian Sea is estimated
   to be 681 000 t by 11 million seabirds of which Atlantic puffins
   (Fratereula arctica) are the major consumers (240 000 t, 36\%), followed
   by northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) (200 000 t, 29\%). 50\% of the
   harvest in the Norwegian Sea is of lean fish, and 40\% invertebrates.
   Although these consumption rates are probably in the right order of
   magnitude, errors still arise from uncertainties concerning bird diets
   and numbers in the region at any one time (especially of birds which
   breed elsewhere and visit the sea in question outside the breeding
   season). While the percentages of invertebrates consumed in the two seas
   are similar, those taken in the Norwegian Sea consist mainly of benthic
   organisms eaten by common eiders (Somateria mollissima) while those
   eaten in the Barents Sea are mainly pelagic crustaceans taken by
   Brunnich's guillemots and northern fulmars. Compared to other predators
   such as cod (Gadus morhua), whales, seals, and humans, seabirds account
   for a minor part (8-15\%) of the total harvest and even less (5-11\%) of
   the fish harvest of top predators in the Barents Sea. (C) 2002

Abstract = {The abundance of salmon lice was examined in two stocks of sympatric
   anadromous Arctic char and sea trout in sub-Arctic regions in northern
   Norway in June, July, and August 1992 and 1993. One stock feeds in a
   coastal area exposed to moderate salmon farming activity (exposed area),
   while the other feed in a region without salmon farms (unexposed area).
   The salmon lice infestation on both species differed significantly
   between the exposed and unexposed area as well as between years and also
   between weeks within the same year. We did not detect, however, any
   clear significant differences in salmon lice abundance between sympatric
   populations of Arctic char and sea trout, or between different size
   groups of the species. The 1992 and 1993 infestation pattern in the
   exposed area showed an epidemic tendency in both Arctic char and sea
   trout, characterised by a sudden increase in both prevalence and
   abundance of lice larvae in July 1992 (23.6 +/- 25.7 lice/fish) and
   August 1993 (19.9 +/- 20.8 lice/fish). We therefore suggest that salmon
   lice epidemics, previously only observed on sea trout, may also occur in
   populations of Arctic char, and that fish farming contributes to the
   elevated lice level in wild fish. The fish in the unexposed area were
   also infested, although at significantly lower levels than fish from the
   exposed area. The infestation peaked in August 1992 at 13.0 +/- 18.1
   lice/fish and August 1993 at 3.9 +/- 4.5 lice/fish, suggested that lice
   originating on ascending wild Atlantic salmon, or lice larvae drifting
   from farming areas, may infest Arctic char and sea trout also in
   unexposed localities in Subarctic areas. (C) 2002 International Council

Abstract = {In Procollariiformes, parents guard the chick for some time after it has
   attained homeothermy. Such a strategy may have evolved to protect the
   chick from predation or inclement weather, but it is costly because only
   one parent can forage at a time. Therefore, the decision to leave the
   chick seems to be a trade-off between the chick's ability to care for
   itself, body condition of the parent present at the nest, and ability of
   the bird out foraging to return to the nest before its mate's body
   condition has degraded. We studied chick growth and survival together
   with number of days Snow Petrel (Pagodroma nivea) chicks were guarded
   before being left alone for the first time in relation to the parents
   body condition and ability to return to the nest in time. Parents in
   good body condition were more likely to produce a chick that survived
   the guard stage. They also guarded their chick for a longer period
   (range 2-8 days, (x) over bar = 4.5) and finally left it alone with a
   higher body mass than those in poor body condition. However, whether the
   foraging bird was able to return to the nest in time to relieve its mate
   was also strongly related to number of days the chick was guarded and
   its body mass. The chicks' survival from when they were left alone and
   until day 10 posthatch was positively related both to number of days
   they were guarded and their body condition (body mass corrected for
   age).},

Abstract = {Lycaenid butterflies of the Aricia agestis-artaxerxes complex pose an
   unresolved taxonomic and conservation problem in north-western Europe.
   Two key issues require resolution: (i) how many species of Aricia occur
   in north-western Europe and what are their distributions?; (ii) how is
   the morphological variation observed in north-western Europe best
   explained? We investigated phylogenetic relationships and
   phylogeographic patterns in this species group using mitochondrial and
   nuclear markers in comparison with morphological variation. A 325 bp
   fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene was sequenced from 179
   individuals representing 18 populations from the UK and Scandinavia.
   Seventeen enzyme-coding loci were analysed from 538 individuals from the
   same populations. Highly congruent phylogenies between mitochondrial and
   allozyme markers demonstrate that the sample is composed of two closely
   related species, A. agestis and A. artaxerxes. Both marker types also
   suggest that Scottish and northern Scandinavian A. artaxerxes
   populations are conspecific, and consequently do not support the endemic
   status of A. artaxerxes in the UK. The subspecies division of British
   populations of A. artaxerxes is also not supported by phylogenetic
   analyses. Allozyme and mitochondrial analyses cluster two populations
   from the Peak District, UK, differently. The former suggests that they
   are A. artaxerxes whilst the latter suggests they are A. agestis.
   Further research is required to find the reason for this disagreement,
   which could be associated with the different dynamics of nuclear and
   mitochondrial genes across a hybrid zone between the two species. (C)

   years 1987-1992 as compared to 1979-1986. This was due to removal of
   small crayfish, high exploitation and the establishment of dense stands
   of Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis).
   Baited traps catch a large fraction of crayfish < 95 mm total length
   minimum size. These should according to the regulations immediately be
   released into the lake. However, it is apparent from the size
   composition that release of these small crayfish was rather incomplete.
   In 1983, trap mesh size was increased from 17.5 mm to 21 mm to reduce
   the fraction of undersized crayfish in the trap catches, yet no effects
   of this increased mesh size on crayfish size distribution were observed.
   The legal season has been reduced three times during the study period.
   In 1983, the closing date was changed from 31 December to 15 September.
   In 1989 the legal season was further reduced to two weeks and finally in
   1995 to 10 days. This reduced total trap effort by 45\%. The shorter
   season allow many crayfish to moult twice instead of once between
   seasons and the fraction of large crayfish has thus increased and so has
   the catch per trap night. Canadian pondweed has established dense annual
   stands and thus has made large parts of the shallow areas unsuitable for
   crayfish, causing an overall decrease in crayfish population size and
   production.},

Abstract = {The seawater tolerance of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts reared
   under identical hatchery conditions was assessed in two Norwegian
   strains: AquaGen and Imsa. Plasma ion levels were disrupted in both
   strains following seawater exposure, but these disruptions were more
   profound in the AquaGen fish. To investigate the mechanisms underlying
   these differences, we measured gill Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase
   (ATPase) activity and mRNA levels of Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-subunit and two
   isoforms of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
   (CFTR). Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity rose significantly in both strains
   following seawater exposure. Both Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-subunit and CFTR I
   mRNA levels were significantly elevated for the entire 2-week period
   following seawater exposure, whereas CFTR II levels were transiently
   elevated during the first 24 h only. There were no differences in enzyme
   activity or gene expression between strains, with the exception of CFTR
   II, which was significantly lower in the Imsa strain 2 weeks following
   seawater exposure. This suggests that although changes in mRNA and
   protein expression for these genes are associated with seawater
   transfer, they are not the basis of observed physiological differences
   between strains.},

Journal = {ECOSCIENCE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {375-385},
Abstract = {The relationship between treeline position and field-layer diversity in
   the central Norwegian Mountains is examined by the use of multivariate
   techniques. Species and environmental data from altitudinal transects
   across the entire forest-tundra ecotone and various altitudinal
   partitions are analysed. The main variation in the species data show
   positive correspondence with altitude and distance to treeline and
   forest line and negative correspondence with factors related to the
   structure and presence of a tree cover. Distance to the treeline
   explained most of the variance in species distribution and most
   distribution boundaries are found in the vicinity of the treeline.
   Topography is an apparent factor only in a zone just above the treeline,
   and there is no correspondence between species occurrence and altitude
   in this zone. The importance of aspect is only evident at high
   altitudes, where plant communities are most exposed to abiotic
   environmental factors. Descending tree communities during the Holocene
   have produced plant communities above the present treeline that still
   are dependent on environmental conditions previously provided by the
   forest. Under present alpine conditions the main structuring force for
   vegetation composition is changed from being mainly biotic to abiotic.
   The long-term inertia of the field-layer composition across the
   forest-tundra ecotone is important to consider when making predictions
   of future responses of the ecotone.},

   birch forests of northern Norway},
Journal = {ECOSCIENCE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {470-481},
Abstract = {Coastal birch forests in northern Norway have over the last 50 years
   gradually been replaced with non-native spruce plantations. To
   investigate possible changes in bird communities, we compared species
   richness and composition in six forest types (mature spruce plantations,
   ecotones, mixed forests, and three birch forest types) in two regions
   over two years. In the southern region, birch forests tended to host a
   higher number of species than spruce plantations, but species
   composition differed between forest types. The species composition in
   rich birch forests was particularly distinguished from spruce
   plantations, but also from the less productive birch habitats.
   Furthermore, there were dissimilarities in species richness and
   composition between regions. Ground nesters and species nesting on their
   northern margins occur-red most frequently in the southern region,
   whereas cavity-nesters were most abundant in the northern region. Some
   species declined in abundance from 1998 to 1999, whereas three species
   shifted their main distribution from birch forests to mixed
   forests/ecotones. Possible factors underlying these results are
   discussed. We recommend that researchers and managers pay attention to
   habitat qualities within forest types (i.e., other than tree species
   composition in overstory) as well as to regional variations in species
   assemblages when addressing outcomes of management practices.},

Abstract = {The two traditional approaches to the study of costs of reproduction,
   cor relational and experimental, have been used in parallel in a
   breeding colony of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) and were
   compared in this paper. The analysis of the observational data was based
   on a two-strata capture-recapture model, the strata being defined on the
   basis of the clutch size laid by individual females in a given year. The
   best model according to AIC(C) indicated substantial variation in
   survival, recapture and transition rates, but overall a pattern emerged:
   females laying large clutches have a somewhat higher survival and much
   higher capture rate than females laying small clutches, and transition
   from large to small clutch size occurs much more frequently than the
   reverse transition. The analysis of the experimental data
   (adding/removing one egg) showed that no clear effect was found on
   either survival or transition rates. We conclude by suggesting (1) that
   condition should be included in multi-strata models in addition to
   reproductive effort; (2) that a specific study design for estimating the
   proportion of non-breeding females should be implemented, and (3) that
   non-breeding (a non-observable state in this study) may be influenced by
   previous reproduction events.},

Title = {Testing the effect of conspecific reproductive success on dispersal and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Factors affecting dispersal and recruitment in animal populations will
   play a prominent role in the dynamics of populations. This is
   particularly the case for subdivided populations where the dispersal of
   individuals among patches may lead to local extinction and `rescue
   effects'. A long-term observational study carried out in Brittany,
   France, and involving colour-ringed Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa
   tridactyla) suggested that the reproductive success of conspecifics (or
   some social cor relate) could be one important factor likely to affect
   dispersal and recruitment. By dispersing from patches where the local
   reproductive success was low and recruiting to patches where the local
   reproductive success was high, individual birds could track
   spatio-temporal variations in the quality of breeding patches (the
   quality of breeding patches can be affected by different factors, such
   as food availability, the presence of predators or ectoparasites, which
   can vary in space and time at different scales). Such an observational
   study may nevertheless have confounded the role of conspecific
   reproductive success with the effect of a cor related factor (e. g. the
   local activities of a predator). In other words, individuals may have
   been influenced directly by the factor responsible for the low local
   reproductive success or indirectly by the low success of their
   neighbours. Thus, an experimental approach was needed to address this
   question. Estimates of demographic parameters (other than reproductive
   success) and studies of the response of marked individuals to changes in
   their environment usually face problems associated with variability in
   the probability of detecting individuals and with non-independence among
   events occur ring on a local scale. Further, very few studies on
   dispersal have attempted to address the causal nature of relationships
   by experimentally manipulating factors. Here we present an experiment
   designed to test for an effect of local reproductive success of
   conspecifics on behavioural decisions of individuals regarding dispersal
   and recruitment. The experiment was carried out on Kittiwakes within a
   large seabird colony in northern Norway. It involved (i) the colour
   banding of several hundreds of birds; (ii) the manipulation
   (increase/decrease) of the local reproductive success of breeding groups
   on cliffpatches; and (iii) the detailed survey of attendance and
   activities of birds on these patches. It also involved the manipulation
   of the nest content of marked individuals breeding within these patches
   (individuals failing at the egg stage were expected to respond in terms
   of dispersal to the success of their neighbours). This allowed us to
   test whether a lower local reproductive success would lower (1) the
   attendance of breeders at the end of the breeding season; (2) the
   presence of prospecting birds; and (3) the proportion of failed breeders
   that came back to breed on the same patch the year after. In this paper,
   we discuss how we dealt with (I) the use of return rates to infer
   differences in dispersal rates; (II) the trade-off between sample sizes
   and local treatment levels; and (III) potential differences in detection
   probabilities among locations. We also present some results to
   illustrate the design and implementation of the experiment.},

Abstract = {We studied depredation rates on free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries)
   bv Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in 2 areas in Norway to test whether
   selected individuals or a demographic group within a lynx population
   kill a disproportionate share of livestock. During 6 grazing seasons
   from 1994 to 1999, we monitored 34 radiocollared lynx during 641
   tracking periods (either all night or during a full 24-hr period).
   Sixty-three domestic sheep and 3 domestic goats were killed by
   radiocollared lynx during these periods. All of the radiocollared lynx
   had access to free-ranging domestic sheep within their annual home
   ranges. Male lynx killed sheep more frequently than females and were
   responsible for 12 out of 13 cases of surplus killing. After adjusting
   for number of nights monitored, sheep-killing rates among males differed
   slightly, whereas the differences between individual females were
   correlated with the number of sheep available. There were no indications
   of any special ``problem individuals,{''} but rather a ``problem
   sex.{''} There fore, it seems to be intrinsic in their behavior that
   males are likely to kill domestic animals more frequently than females.
   The lack of specific problem individuals in this study might depend on
   the livestock-herding technique used in Norway, where sheep generally
   are free-ranging and unattended throughout a lynx's home range.
   Selective removal of depredating males requires that the gap in the
   social mosaic either remains unfilled or is filled by an individual that
   causes less damage to livestock. The effects of such removal on sheep
   depredation are likely to be only temporary since all adult and yearling
   male lynx appear to kill sheep.},

   patchiness with characteristic scales of 200 to 300 km and 70 km
   respectively. We found close relationships between yearly variation in
   capelin abundance, capelin patchiness and the concordance between
   capelin and murres at both levels. The patchiness of capelin, as
   measured by the first-order spatial autocorrelation, increased with
   increasing capelin abundance at the large-scale level, and there was a
   similar tendency at the small-scale level. At the large-scale level, the
   spatial concordance between murres and capelin increased with both
   increasing capelin density and increasing capelin patchiness. At the
   small-scale level, the concordance between murres and capelin increased
   with increasing capelin patchiness. Our results suggest that increased
   prey patchiness and increased prey abundance enhance the possibility of
   murres finding satisfactory capelin concentrations. The reduction in
   prey patchiness with low prey abundance might force predators to switch
   to other prey items, and might therefore have a stabilizing effect on
   predator-prey interactions.},

Abstract = {An accumulating body of research identifies the importance of landscape
   structure for a wide range of countryside interests. Landscape structure
   reflects the results of policies and practices, and is well-suited as a
   target for management actions. New landscape metrics represent a
   potential for indicator-based management, provided such metrics relate
   consistently to the landscape values of interest. In this paper we
   propose that aspects of landscape structure. specifically heterogeneity,
   may be related to landscape-based values such as biodiversity, cultural
   heritage and human appreciation. Birds and vascular plants correlated
   well with our index for the heterogeneity of land types., whereas
   insects did not. Occurrence of prehistoric graves was also associated
   with land type heterogeneity, though other types of cultural remains
   were not. Landscape experience seems to be associated with the
   heterogeneity of landscape space rather than heterogeneity of land
   types. Different aspects of heterogeneity, scale, and variation over
   time all contribute to explain how our measures of landscape-based
   values vary in their relationship to landscape heterogeneity. Successful
   integration between disciplines in landscape studies depends on having a
   common operational framework, a shared theoretical basis, and a
   harmonised approach to data collection, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Journal = {AQUACULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {32},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The abundance of salmon lice and the physiological effects of infection
   were examined in two stocks of sympatric sea trout and anadromous Arctic
   char in northern Norway. One stock feed in a coastal area with extensive
   salmon farming (exposed locality), while the other feed in a region with
   little farming activity (unexposed locality). The results showed that
   the lice infection was significantly higher at the exposed locality, at
   which the mean intensity of infection peaked in June and July at over
   100 and 200 lice larvae per fish respectively. At the exposed locality
   we also observed a premature return to freshwater of the most heavily
   infected fish. Such behaviour has previously been interpreted as a
   response by the fish to reduce the stress caused by the infection and/or
   to enhance survival. Blood samples taken from sea trout at sea at the
   exposed locality showed a positive correlation between intensity of
   parasite infection and an increase in the plasma cortisol, chloride and
   blood glucose concentrations, while the correlations from sea trout in
   freshwater were more casual. Several indices pointed towards an
   excessive mortality of the heaviest infected fish, and 47\% of the fish
   caught in freshwater and 32\% of those captured at sea carried lice at
   intensities above the level that has been shown to induce mortality in
   laboratory experiments. Furthermore, almost half of all fish from the
   exposed locality had lice intensities that would probably cause
   osmoregulatory imbalance. High salmon lice infections may therefore have
   profound negative effects upon wild populations of sea trout. At the
   unexposed location, the infection intensities were low, and few fish
   carried more than 10 lice. These are probably within the normal range of
   natural infection and such intensities are not expected to affect the
   stock negatively.},

Abstract = {During 5-7 October 1999, 16 cichlids (30.5-51.0 cm) were tagged with
   radio transmitters in the Zambezi River in Namibia (eight threespot
   tilapia Oreochromis andersonii, seven pink happy Sargochromis giardi and
   one humpback largemouth Serranochromis altus). The main objectives of
   this pilot study were 1) to assess whether and how telemetry can be used
   to follow the movements of larger cichlids in the upper Zambezi River
   and 2) to study the movements, habitat preferences and homing behavior
   of three cichlid species important for subsistence and trophy fishing
   during a period of increasing water flow towards the rainy period. Nine
   fish showed a downriver movement immediately after release, believed to
   be a behavioral response to catch and tagging. From I I October, only
   small-scale movements were recorded. Average total distance moved from I
   I October to I March was 375 m (range= 1-1150) for threespot tilapia and
   1276 m (range= 540-1990) for pink happy. The farthest position compared
   to the position held on 11 October was on average 220 m away
   (range=0-500) for threespot tilapia and 538 m (range =20-1500) for pink
   happy. Displaced individuals did not show homing to the catch site. The
   threespot tilapia were, on average, located in the main river during
   67\% of the tracking surveys, in backwaters during 13\% and in mouth of
   backwaters during 20\%. The pink happy were, on average, located in the
   main river during 71\% of the tracking surveys, in backwaters during
   25\% and in mouth of backwaters during 4\%.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Experimental data for maximum growth and food consumption of Atlantic
   Salmon (Salmo salar L.) parr from five Norwegian rivers situated between
   59 and 70 degreesN were analysed and modelled. The growth and feeding
   models were also applied to groups of Atlantic Salmon growing and
   feeding at rates below the maximum. The data were fitted to the
   Ratkowsky model, originally developed for bacterial growth.
   2. The rates of growth and food consumption varied significantly among
   populations but the variation appeared unrelated to thermal conditions
   in the river of population origins. No correlation was found between the
   thermal conditions and limits for growth, thermal growth optima or
   maximum growth, and hypotheses of population-specific thermal adaptation
   were not supported. Estimated optimum temperatures for growth were
   between 16 and 20 degreesC.
   3. Model parameter estimates differed among growth-groups in that
   maximum growth and the performance breadth decreased from fast to slow
   growing individuals. The optimum temperature for growth did not change
   with growth rate.
   4. The model for food consumption (expressed in energy terms) peaked at
   19-21 degreesC, which is only slightly higher than the optimal
   temperature for growth. Growth appeared directly related to food
   consumption. Consumption was initiated approximate to2 degreesC below
   the lower temperature for growth and terminated approximate to1.5
   degreesC above the upper critical temperature for growth. Model
   parameter estimates for consumption differed among growth-groups in a
   manner similar to the growth models.
   5. By combining the growth and consumption models, growth efficiencies
   were estimated. The maximum efficiencies were high, 42-58\%, and higher
   in rivers offering hostile than benign feeding and growth opportunities.},

Year = {2001},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-42},

Abstract = {The effect of investigator activity on Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa
   tridactyla) was assessed using the disturbance caused by an ongoing
   intensive study investigating chick growth and adult mass loss. Though
   the effects were small, investigator disturbance decreased adult nest
   attendance and increased daily chick loss rates. Whereas overall chick
   survival until day 18 post-hatch was significantly lower in the
   high-disturbance plot in the first year of the study, it was
   substantially higher in the second year. We hypothesize that changes in
   predator activity as an indirect consequence of disturbance were
   responsible for this pattern. Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) which
   nested near the high-disturbance plot and are the main predator of
   kittiwakes in our study area may have been more susceptible to the
   effect of disturbance than the kittiwakes themselves. There was
   otherwise no statistically significant impact of disturbance on chick
   growth, or on adult kittiwakes extending into the following year. Biases
   in studies of kittiwakes due to investigator disturbance may thus be
   negligible when the study is carefully designed. Future studies
   investigating effects of disturbance on birds should, however, include
   data concerning potential predators of the focal species and include
   more than one low-disturbance plot, and should be carried out over two
   or more years.},

Abstract = {This paper reports an experimental study of water dispersal potential
   and germination of the shingle beach plant Mertensia maritima in which
   we consider the effects of physical factors (cold treatment, mechanical
   wear of the pericarp and salt-water exposure) on the diaspores. Our
   approach also includes testing effects of different orders of the
   treatments. in contrast to most earlier studies of diaspore ecology. A
   cold period was necessary to break seed dormancy, and prolonged cold
   treatment (stratification at 2degreesC) enhanced germination. Mechanical
   wear of the pericarp before cold treatment did not affect germination,
   whereas mechanical wear after cold treatment increased germination
   significantly. Seeds exposed to 6 weeks of cold treatment before
   floating in salt water for 6 weeks did not germinate. In contrast, for
   seeds given the same cold treatment after floating, the germination was
   more than 50\%. Most undamaged and slightly damaged nutlets stayed
   afloat throughout the dispersal experiment (9 weeks) in 3\% salt water,
   whereas seeds that fell out of damaged nutlets sunk immediately. Thus,
   the results suggest that the potential for long-distance dispersal is
   high unless the diaspores (nutlets) are severely damaged, but the order
   of cold treatment and water dispersal seems to be of great importance
   for germination: seeds dispersed in autumn (before cold periods) have a
   much higher probability of germinating than seeds dispersed in winter or
   early spring (after a cold period). Similar effects of the relative
   timing of physical processes have hitherto only been reported for two
   other water-dispersed beach plants. Future studies in diaspore ecology
   should consider such timing effects as they may be important
   determinants of the distribution and abundance of plants.},

Abstract = {The taeniid tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis is here reported for
   the first time at the Svalbard Archipelago in the Norwegian Arctic. This
   new finding is interesting because the establishment of E.
   multilocularis is due to a recent anthropogenic introduction of its
   intermediate host - the sibling vole Microtus rossiaemeridionalis at
   Svalbard. The parasite itself has probable,, become naturally
   transferred to Svalbard due to migratory movements of its final host -
   the arctic fox Alopex lagopus between source areas for E. multilocularis
   in Siberia and Svalbard. We report macroscopically determined prevalence
   of E. multilocularis from a sample of 224 voles trapped in August in
   1999 and 2000, The prevalence was among the highest ever recorded in
   intermediate hosts and was dependent on age and sex of the hosts
   approaching 100\% in over-wintered males. The high prevalence and the
   simplicity of the vole - arctic fox - E. multilocularis system at
   Svalbard makes it an eminent model system for further epidemiological

Title = {Comparative feeding ecology of Steller's Eider and long-tailed ducks in
   winter},
Journal = {WATERBIRDS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {407-412},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We examined the flexibility in feeding ecology of Steller's Eider
   (Polysticta stellen) by comparing its diet to the taxonomically
   relatively close Long-tailed Duck (Clangula hyemalis) during two winter
   periods (early and late) when the two species occurred together.
   Steller's Eider generally fed on the same type of prey in early and late
   winter, with a dietary overlap of 43\% between the two periods (57\%
   among shelled prey). The mean number of prey species per bird was 7.8 in
   both early winter and late winter. In contrast, the Long-tailed Duck
   changed completely from feeding on benthic invertebrates in early winter
   to spawning Capelin (Mallotus villosus) in late winter. The dietary
   overlap between the two bird species was 38\% in early winter. In early
   winter, the mean number of prey species was 5.5 in the Long-tailed Duck,
   and not significantly different from the Steller's Eider. Steller's
   Eider seemed to be restricted to small prey, both compared to
   availability of sizes and also to the prey size taken by the Long-tailed
   Duck. Thus the worldwide rare Steller's Eider seems to be a specialist
   with limited ability to exploit different food resources, while the
   numerous Long-tailed Duck is an opportunistic generalist. Low
   flexibility in feeding ecology indicates that winter habitats for
   Steller's Eider may be limited, and protection of these areas would
   probably benefit the species.},

Abstract = {Managing ungulate populations in a sustainable way requires monitoring
   plans to provide useful information about population status and trend.
   Our aim is to evaluate the use of hunters to collect information about
   the status of caribou Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus in Greenland.
   Caribou have been harvested under a quota system since 1995 in four
   regions of west Greenland. In each year, hunters were asked to return
   information on the sex, approximate age and body condition of animals
   harvested, and lower jawbones were collected from animals shot in 1995.
   The harvest is strongly sex-biased (90:10) towards males. Jawbone length
   did not vary among regions. Age-specific tooth wear was, however, most
   pronounced in the northern region (Sisimiut-Kangerlussuaq), probably due
   to the nature of the substrate in the area. The condition of animals,
   based on a rump-fat index, appears to be good over all west Greenland,
   with some slight but consistent differences between regions. We conclude
   that information provided by hunters will be useful in monitoring the
   caribou populations, but validation of their information is required.},

Abstract = {The problem of optimal adaptation of reindeer herds to rangelands under
   uncertain environmental conditions and measurement errors is studied by
   stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) and by stochastic optimisation in
   policy space (SOPS). The study expands on earlier studies by including
   measurement error, body weights, alternatives to lichen in winter
   pastures, wastage of lichen by cratering reindeer, and by including both
   summer and winter pastures in the same model. The analysis shows that it
   is important to get precise estimates of lichen growth, alternatives to
   lichen are only important if their digestibility is above a minimum
   level, variable costs only matter for the optimal herd size when summer
   grazing is limiting, modest discounting has little effect, the policy is
   not sensitive to the degree of natural variation, while the value of
   reindeer husbandry is significantly reduced by increasing climatic
   variation, the policy is sensitive to measurement error, and there; is a
   considerable value of higher precision in measurements. (C) 2001

Abstract = {In a recent analysis Woodroffe (2000) found a positive relationship
   between historical patterns of large carnivore extinction probability
   and human population density. However, much of the data in this analysis
   came from a period when carnivore extermination was a management
   objective. In order to explore the hypothesis that large carnivores can
   persist at high human densities when the management regime is more
   favourable we have repeated the analysis using up-to-date data from
   North America and Europe. In North America we found that large carnivore
   populations have increased after favourable legislation was introduced,
   despite further increases in human population density. In Europe we
   found no clear relationship between present carnivore distribution and
   human population density. We therefore believe that the existence of
   effective wildlife management structures is more important than human
   density per se.},

Abstract = {We studied the developmental stability of brown trout, Salmo trutta L.,
   in 10 populations (five acidified, five control) in Nor-way, measured as
   fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and departure from the morphological norm. We
   measured four meristic and four morphometric characters, and scored the
   level of biochemical heterozygosity at 49 loci (20 polymorphic). We
   reared eggs of a single population in a hatchery using four different
   water qualities (three replicates of each treatment) to test the effect
   of acidification stress on developmental instability. There were no
   significant differences in the level of FA, in departure from the
   morphological norm between brown trout sampled from lakes with acidified
   or control water qualities, or in brown trout hatched at different water
   qualities. There was no correlation between level of heterozygosity and
   FA or departure from the morphological norm, either when tested within
   populations or among populations. There were no single-locus effects on
   developmental stability tested for 11 loci. We conclude that measures of
   developmental stability or morphological variability are not useful for
   detecting acidification stress in brown trout. Furthermore, we conclude
   that developmental stability in our material varies independently of
   heterozygosity. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.},

Abstract = {In the present study we investigated the effect of stress and cortisol
   on cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression in Arctic charr exposed to
   benzo{[}a]pyrene (BaP). Expression of hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A was
   monitored 8 d after a single oral dose of BaP (10 mg/kg fish) and
   compared to that in unexposed fish. During this period the fish were
   subjected to one of the following stress regimes: no stress. no stress
   and cortisol implantation, 10 min of daily handling and confinement
   stress, and confinement stress during the last 6 h before sampling. In
   BaP-exposed fish daily stress resulted in significantly lower (53\%)
   CYP1A protein levels as compared to those in unstressed fish. For CYPIA
   catalytic activity (measured as 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase {[}EROD]
   activity), the suppressive response to stress was less pronounced. These
   results contrast to previous findings of a potentiation by
   corticosteroids on xenobiotic-dependent CYPIA induction in vitro in
   cultured fish hepatic cells. No effects of high cortisol levels or BaP
   were found on the steroid-metabolizing CYP3A enzyme levels. The lack of
   any alterations in the CYP3A protein level indicates that CYP3A
   expression is not inducible by cortisol in the Arctic chart under the
   conditions used here. The conclusion was made that short-term stress
   associated with sampling (i.e.. 6 It of confinement stress before
   sampling) of wild charr does not compromise the EROD activity as a
   reliable biomarker.},

Title = {Plant phenology, migration and geographical variation in body weight of
   a large herbivore: the effect of a variable topography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {915-923},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. A central concept in ruminant foraging ecology is that even slight
   changes in plant quality affect body growth substantially, because
   ruminants not only gain more protein and energy but also use less time
   for rumination when eating high-quality forage. Increased access to
   highly nutritious forage is thus regarded as an important driving force
   in the evolution of migration in large herbivores, because the temporal
   and spatial variation in plant quality is huge. Body weight is in turn a
   major determinant of reproductive performance and survival in ungulates,
   and therefore important for population dynamics.
   2. In the temperate region, the vertical movement of cervids from a
   low-elevation winter range to a high-elevation summer range is the most
   common pattern of migration. Migration to high elevations during summer
   is regarded as a strategy to increase energy intake among northern
   temperate ungulates.
   3. It has been suggested that there is increased forage quality at high
   elevation. This leads to the prediction that body weights are positively
   correlated with the proportion of high-altitude habitat. Alternatively,
   cervids may benefit due to prolonged access to newly emerged forage as
   they migrate along an altitudinal gradient. If so, it can be predicted
   that body weights are highest in regions with the highest diversity of
   different altitudes.
   4. The facing of slopes, i.e. the aspect, is also regarded as an
   important part of the habitat for deer. Access to north-facing slopes is
   regarded as favourable because plant quality may be higher on
   north-facing slopes; access to a variety of different aspects is also
   favourable because this may lead to a variable snow melt and thus a
   longer time period with access to high-quality forage.
   5. In order to test the above predictions (under points 3 and 4), we
   analysed the spatial variability of body weight of 8452 female and 12
   474 male red deer harvested during 1975-98 from 105 municipalities in
   Norway.
   6. Body weight of red deer was positively related to the diversity of
   altitudes, and negatively related to the proportion of high-altitude
   habitat per se. This demonstrated that the altitudinal migration of
   cervids is not necessarily due to increased forage quality at high
   elevation, but rather that migrating cervids gain from prolonged access
   to newly emerging forage along an altitudinal gradient as they migrate
   to high elevation during early summer.
   7. There was also no support for the hypothesis that access to a high
   proportion of north-facing slopes was favourable; rather, body weight of
   red deer was correlated with access to a diversity of aspects. There was
   thus clear evidence that a variable topography, measured as different
   altitude levels and aspects, was positively related to body weight of
   red deer.
   8. We discuss the possible causes of why an ideal free distribution is
   not reached, and conclude that phenological differences in plants
   related to topography can have a large impact on body weights of
   cervids, and therefore induce considerable spatial heterogeneity in
   population dynamics.},

Abstract = {The males of lekking species are not expected to be choosy about mating
   because a reduced reproductive rate due to lost mating opportunities
   should outweigh any benefits of male choice. Females have traditionally
   not been expected to be competitive in this system since their
   reproduction has usually been assumed to be unconstrained by male
   availability. Here we show that, in contrast to these predictions, males
   are choosy and females may be competitive in the lekking great snipe
   Gallinago media. Males preferred by many females often refused to
   copulate with and even chased away females that the male had already
   copulated with, whereas females seemed to compete for repeated
   copulations. We conclude that choosiness may sometimes pay for popular
   males in those lekking species where females copulate repeatedly.
   Apparently, evolutionary conflicts of interest between individuals may
   cause a richer repertoire of behavioural adaptations than, to our
   knowledge, hitherto realized.},

Abstract = {Here, we present, to the authors' knowledge for the very first time for
   a small marsupial, a thorough analysis of the demography and population
   dynamics of the mouse opossum (Thylamys elegans) in western South
   America. We test the relative importance of feedback structure and
   climatic factors (rainfall and the Southern Oscillation Index) in
   explaining the temporal variation in the demography of the mouse
   opossum. The demographic information was incorporated into a
   stage-structured population dynamics model and the model's predictions
   were compared with observed patterns. The mouse opossum's capture rates
   showed seasonal (within-year) and between-year variability, with
   individuals having higher capture rates during late summer and autumn
   and lower capture rates during winter and spring. There was also a
   strong between-year effect on capture probabilities. The reproductive
   (the fraction of reproductively active individuals) and recruitment
   rates showed a clear seasonal and a between-year pattern of variation
   with the peak of reproductive activity occuring during winter and early
   spring. In addition, the fraction of reproductive individuals was
   positively related to annual rainfall, while population density and
   annual rainfall positively influenced the recruitment rate. The survival
   rates were negatively related to annual rainfall. The average finite
   population growth rate during the study period was estimated to be 1.011
   +/- 0.0019 from capture-recapture estimates. While the annual growth
   rate estimated from the seasonal linear matrix models was 1.026, the
   subadult and adult survival and maturation rates represent between 54\%
   (winter) and 81\% (summer) of the impact on the annual growth rate.},

Title = {Influence of o ` p-DDD on the physiological response to stress in Arctic
   charr (Salvelinus alpinus)},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {179-193},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Various toxicants have previously been held responsible for an impaired
   capacity of fish from polluted environments to elevate their cortisol
   levels in response to stress. In the present study we investigated the
   responses to stress in o'p-DDD
   {[}2-(chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorphenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane] exposed (given
   a single, oral dose of 75 mg o'p-DDD/kg fish) and unexposed Arctic
   charr. After o'p-DDD administration fish were left undisturbed and
   without being fed for 28 days, when they were subjected to an acute
   handling stress. At 1, 3, 7 and 23 h following stress, primary (ACTH and
   cortisol secretion) and secondary (plasma Cl levels and energy
   mobilisation) components of the stress response were monitored. As the
   nutritional state of wild fish may influence this potential biomarker
   response, the fish had been subjected to a restricted feed ration prior
   to o'p-DDD administration in order to obtain marked within-group
   variations in condition factor. No effects of o'p-DDD were observed on
   post-stress hormone secretion (i.e. peak post-stress plasma ACTH and
   cortisol levels), nor on plasma chloride levels. However, other results
   obtained provided evidence for a metabolic depression by o'p-DDD,
   witnessed by consistently lower plasma glucose levels before and after
   stress in these contaminated fish. This may be related to the finding
   that during the 30-day period between op-DDD administration and stress
   treatment, toxicant treated fish lost less weight in comparison to their
   sham-treated counterparts. Nutritional state did not appear to influence
   the performance of the charr in the present experiment, as correlations
   between the parameters measured and condition factor or lipid contents
   on an individual basis in all cases turned out non significant. Overall,
   the results contrast with those of previous in vivo and in vitro studies
   on fish, which concluded that comparable headkidney o'p-DDD levels
   impaired interrenal steroidogenesis. Although we conclude that the
   effects of o'p-DDD on Arctic charr metabolism were not associated with
   the stress response, we propose that they may well interfere with the
   animals' ability to cope with stress in the long term, or may compromise
   other physiological processes, such as smoltification. Finally, the high
   level of integration of components involved in the stress response
   complicates the identification of single stress-sensitive indices as
   biomarkers applicable in environmental monitoring programmes. (C) 2001

Abstract = {Southern Norway holds the last remaining population of wild reindeer
   (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Roads, railroads, and power
   lines have fragmented the original population into 26 separate herds.
   The reindeer populations are regulated directly according to
   availability of winter forage. These winter ranges, generally at lower
   elevations, are however, often subjected to development. Effects of
   infrastructure and associated human activity on the distribution of wild
   reindeer during winter were investigated in the Nordfjella mountain
   region of western Norway. Systematic aerial surveys of the distribution
   of ca. 2500 reindeer were conducted during late winter 1986-1998. Areas
   within 2.5 km from power lines were used less than available in 6 of the
   8 sampling years, and areas beyond this zone more than expected. Density
   of reindeer was 79\% lower within 2.5 km from power lines compared with
   background areas, and increased with increasing distance from
   infrastructure for comparable habitat. Available forage in terms of
   lichen cover declined 15-30-fold with distance, and was lowest in the
   undisturbed areas with the highest density of grazing animals. Areas
   within 5 kni from resorts or from roads and power lines in combination
   were avoided in all years. Continued construction of roads, power lines
   and cabin resorts endanger these available winter ranges, and hence the
   long term survival of the population. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The reproductive success of golden eagles was studied in an area in
   western Norway between 62 degrees and 63 degreesN between 1973 and 1999.
   Addled eggs were collected for analysis of chemical pollutants from nine
   territories; five from coastal areas and four from inland. The coastal
   sites had lower annual reproductive output than inland sites, and the
   eggs had a higher content of organochlorine compounds. There were
   relatively strong negative correlations between reproductive output and
   (1) shell thickness and (2) DDE concentration in eggs. The data indicate
   that the golden eagle may be a particularly sensitive species to DDE. It
   is proposed that the higher organochlorine content found in the eggs of
   coastal birds was caused by a contribution of marine birds to the diet,
   as opposed to inland eagles which have a prey basis consisting almost
   entirely of terrestrial herbivores such as grouse, mountain hare and
   cervids. Our data-set on reproductive output is, however, too small to
   establish a general relationship between DDE contamination and
   reproductive output in golden eagles.},

Volume = {59},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {From a total of 174 multi-sea-winter Atlantic salmon radio tagged in the
   Tanafjord (northern Norway, 70 degrees N) during 1992 and 1993, 48
   Atlantic salmon were followed from entering the River Tana until
   spawning. Three phases were identified: (1) migratory, direct or
   stepwise migration to, or close to the position held at spawning; (2)
   search, movements both up and down river at or close to the position
   held at spawning; (3) holding, a period without movements prior to
   spawning. During the migratory phase, Atlantic salmon migrated directly
   to near the spawning area, or stopped between one and nine shorter
   periods during the upstream migration. Number of stops increased with
   increasing migratory distance in 1993, but no such correlation was found
   in 1992. The highest migratory speeds were recorded in the lower parts
   of the river. A distinct change in migratory pattern was found in 67\%
   of the Atlantic salmon near or at the area held at spawning. Most common
   was a search phase of erratic movements with more than one down river
   movement. After the movement terminated, 96\% of the Atlantic salmon had
   a period when no or little movement was recorded until spawning (on
   average 55 days in 1992 and 51 days in 1993). There was no preference
   for staying at, up or down river from the spawning area during this
   holding period. Early ascending Atlantic salmon migrated to spawning
   areas further from the mouth than the later arriving Atlantic salmon in
   1993, but not in 1992. The proportion or time spent on the migratory
   phase increased, while the proportion of time spent on the holding phase
   decreased with increasing distance to the spawning area. (C) 2001 The

Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1023-1032},

Abstract = {A remote monitoring system was developed to provide information on the
   behaviour of mature and immature Atlantic salmon Salmo salar parr at
   nests during the spawning season. An octagonal passive integrated
   transponder (PIT) detector (0.865 in maximum diameter) designed to
   surround nests of Atlantic salmon was used to identify individual salmon
   parr present at 38 spawning events in three circular spawning channels.
   The range of the detector for PIT tags presented in the optimum
   orientation was 2.4 cm (range between tags 1.7-3.0 cm). Using a
   sub-sample of 20 spawnings, the mean efficiency of the detector (number
   of fish passes, registered relative to number of passes observed on
   video) was 70.5\% (range 32-100\%). There were no significant effects of
   time from spawning, total number of registrations, body size or maturity
   status (mature or immature) on efficiency. However, fish were more
   likely to be detected entering nests than leaving, as departures were
   more rapid and hi.-her in the water column. The PIT detector did not
   affect the numbers of parr at spawnings or between-spawning intervals of
   females, and allowed for the individual identification of 65 of the 72
   parr observed in nests during spawning. In all cases where certain
   identifications were not possible and the video was of satisfactory
   quality, this was due to obstruction of the camera view by anadromous
   fish. The remote monitoring system was thus effective in identifying
   behavioural differences, and only one of 20 immature parr was ever
   detected during the period encompassing 10 min before and after spawning
   compared with 30 or 40 mature parr.},

Abstract = {An externally attached radio transmitter and antenna on a farmed
   Atlantic salt-non Salmo salar was overgrown with green algae, mussels,
   seaweed and Balanus sp. after the fish had stayed at sea from December
   1997-July 1998. This observation indicates that fouling may be an
   important factor, which is seldom considered when estimating negative
   effects from tags on the animals. Fouling increases the drag from the
   transmitter, and may affect the swimming speed, energy budget and
   behaviour of the fish. The effect is likely to be most pronounced in
   coastal waters. (C) 2001 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Abstract = {We studied the effects of Svalbard reindeer on the abundance of lichens
   in Spitsbergen, A survey was carried out in 14 areas with contrasting
   reindeer densities. Separate cover estimates for crustose, fructose and
   foliose lichens were taken in each area, and related to the density of
   reindeer pellet groups, a measure of reindeer density. Dominant
   macrolichen families were identified in 10 areas, and a full record of
   macrolichen species was taken in four additional areas. Variation in
   reindeer density is partially due to past overhunting, and subsequent
   incomplete recovery, releasing some areas from reindeer grazing for
   100-200 yr.
   The cover of fruticose lichens was negatively related to reindeer pellet
   group density, indicating suppression by Svalbard reindeer. This makes
   their impact comparable to other members of the Rangifer genus around
   the northern hemisphere. The generally recorded low abundance of lichens
   in the diet of Svalbard reindeer compared to other Rang fer species,
   therefore, was interpreted as the depletion of fruticose lichens in
   Spitsbergen, and a subsequent switch to alternative foods.
   Of all fruticose lichens, Stereocaulon spp. appeared least sensitive to
   grazing. Crustose and foliose lichen cover was independent of reindeer
   pellet group density. The cover of crustose lichen, was significantly
   related to latitude. with,greater cover in more northern areas. Foliose
   lichens were more abundant in places where moss cover was high. We
   conclude that the impact of Svalbard reindeer on lichens is dependent on
   growth form, with fruticose lichens suffering from grazing, whereas
   foliose lichens might indirectly benefit from higher densities of
   reindeer or, like crustose lichens, be controlled by other factors.},

Abstract = {Geographical variation in two related seabird species, the razorbill
   (Alca torch) and common guillemot (Uria aalge), was investigated using
   sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control regions. We
   determined the nucleotide sequence of the variable 5' segment of the
   control region in razorbills and common guillemots from breeding
   colonies across the Atlantic Ocean. The ecology and life history
   characteristics of razorbill and common guillemot are in many respects
   similar. They are both considered highly philopatric and have largely
   overlapping distributions in temperate and subarctic regions of the
   North Atlantic, yet the species were found to differ widely in the
   extent and spatial distribution of mtDNA variation. Moreover, the
   differences in genetic differentiation and diversity were in the
   opposite direction to that expected from a consideration of traditional
   classifications and current population sizes. Indices of genetic
   diversity were highest in razorbill and varied among colonies, as did
   genotype frequencies, suggestive of restrictions to gene flow. The
   distribution of genetic variation suggests that razorbills originated
   from a refugial population in the south-western Atlantic Ocean through
   sequential founder events and subsequent expansion in the east and
   north. In common guillemots, genetic diversity was low and there was a
   lack of geographical structure, consistent with a recent population
   bottleneck, expansion and gene flow. We suggest that the reduced level
   of genetic diversity and differentiation in the common guillemot is
   caused by an inherent propensity for repeated population bottlenecks and
   concomitantly unstable population structure related to their specialized
   feeding ecology.},

Abstract = {In barnacle geese Branta leucopsis, pair-bond members generally remain

   long-lasting pair bonds during their lifetime produce more offspring

   statistically controlling for the birds' life span and the proportion of
   life spent without a partner, two variables that also influence lifetime
   reproductive success. I argue that continuous partnerships are
   maintained in highly competitive goose societies because of the constant
   need for female-male cooperation, without which acquiring adequate

Abstract = {Predator-prey interactions between Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica)
   and newly metamorphosed herring (Clupea harengus) were studied in the
   Lofoten-Rost area in northern Norway using a high-resolution multibeam
   sonar system. Attacks from diving puffins and predatory fish induced
   massive predator-response patterns at the school level, including bend,
   vacuole, hourglass, pseudopodium, herd, and split. All patterns have
   previously been observed, using the same sonar, in schools of adult
   herring attacked by groups of killer whales. Tight ball, the prevailing
   response pattern in adult fish under predation, was not observed, but a
   new pattern, intraschool density propagation, was found and interpreted
   as an analogue to tight-ball formations moving rapidly within the
   school. The observed patterns persisted much longer than in schools of
   adult herring attacked by killer whales, reflecting the different
   hunting strategies. Traditionally, the repertoire of predator responses
   observed in schooling fish has been interpreted as a range of co
   operative tactics to trick predators, but this has recently been
   challenged by authors who suggested that fish that behave the same way
   produce different patterns at group level simply by maintaining a
   minimum approach distance to predators and hiding behind conspecifics
   (the ``selfish herd{''}), and that the particular combination of group
   size and number and behaviour of predators, rather than different
   individual tactics, determines the outcome at group level. Our findings
   support the latter hypothesis.},

Abstract = {We studied patterns of dispersal and sizes of home ranges of juvenile
   wolverines (Gulo gulo). Mean dispersal age was 13 months for both male
   (n = 11) and female (n = 9) wolverines. Females displayed more variation
   in dispersal age (7-26 months) than males (7-18 months). Of the animals
   used in the dispersal analyses, all males and 69\% of females dispersed.
   All sedentary females (n = 4) occupied their mother's territory when she
   died or shifted territory, and no females dispersed from a territory
   vacated by their mother. Competition for resources seemed to determine
   the female dispersal pattern, while competition for mates seemed to
   explain the male dispersal pattern. Dispersal distances averaged 51 km
   for males and 60 km for females. However, this is likely to be an
   underestimation. Eight cases of exploratory movements were observed, and
   on average, these immediately preceded dispersal movements. The size of
   juvenile home ranges of males (85 km(2)) and females (81 km(2))
   corresponded to the home-range area of denning females during the summer
   period. Wolverines have the capacity to recolonize gaps in the present
   distribution of the species in Scandinavia. Other factors, therefore,
   most likely explain the large proportion of vacant wolverine habitats.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the past decade international and national environmental policy and
   action have been dominated by issues generally defined as global
   environmental problems. In this article, we identify the major
   discourses associated with four global environmental issues:
   deforestation, desertification, biodiversity use and climate change.
   These discourses are analysed in terms of their messages, narrative
   structures and policy prescriptions. We find striking parallels in the
   nature and structure of the discourses and in their illegibility at the
   local scale. In each of the four areas there is a global environmental
   management discourse representing a technocentric worldview by which
   blueprints based on external policy interventions can solve global
   environmental dilemmas. Each issue also has a contrasting populist
   discourse that portrays local actors as victims of external
   interventions bringing about degradation and exploitation. The
   managerial discourses dominate in all four issues, but important inputs
   are also supplied to political decisions from populist discourses. There
   are, in addition, heterodox ideas and denial claims in each of these
   areas, to a greater or lesser extent, in which the existence or severity
   of the environmental problem are questioned. We present evidence from
   location-specific research which does not fit easily with the dominant
   managerialist nor with the populist discourses. The research shows that
   policy-making institutions are distanced from the resource users and
   that local scale environmental management moves with a distinct dynamic
   and experiences alternative manifestations of environmental change and
   livelihood imperatives.},

Abstract = {1. Population growth rates of bank vole populations in northern Finland
   were studied using long-term Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) data from two
   large grids (food-addition and control), in 1982-94.
   2. A marked seasonal structure was found for direct density dependence,
   with a stronger density dependence in summer than in other seasons.
   There was no detectable evidence of delayed density dependence,
   consistent with the disappearance of large periodic multi-annual
   fluctuations.
   3. Food-addition resulted in higher densities whereas the effect on the
   seasonal density-dependent structure was negligible.
   4. Stability analysis of the deduced population dynamics model suggests
   that the dynamics were not affected by food addition. Variation in food
   resources is therefore unlikely to be a direct cause for multi-annual
   fluctuations in the studied system. Future studies should aim at linking
   the seasonal structure in the variation of vital rates to the seasonal
   structure in population dynamics.},

Abstract = {The relationship between butterfly diversity and both habitat and
   landscape variables was studied in two areas of southern Sweden. The
   habitat quality of the grasslands was similar in the two study areas but
   the landscape pattern differed in grain size and amount of grassland and
   forest. Using a transect survey method, a total of 3341 butterflies were
   observed and 30 taxa identified. We found that both habitat and
   landscape variables influenced the butterfly diversity of the
   investigated grasslands. Species composition differed markedly between
   the two study areas. A study area with a fine-grained landscape pattern,
   a high cover of semi-natural grassland and many forest edges had twice
   as many butterfly species but half the number of individuals compared
   with a coarser-grained study area with larger grasslands widely spread
   in a matrix of arable fields. The results of our study indicate that
   both habitat quality and landscape pattern have to be considered when
   developing conservation strategies for grassland butterflies.},

Abstract = {We analysed sex- and age-specific harvesting strategies of moose using
   an age-structured population model that includes density dependence as
   well as environmental stochasticity. In order to find the strategy that
   maximises the mean annual yield we simulated the process over a large
   number of years. The mean annual yield is a function of the three
   parameters (number of harvested individuals of calves, adult (greater
   than or equal to1 1/2 years old) bulls and adult females) that are
   involved in the definitions of the strategies. We compare, by numerical
   maximisation of a function in several variables, two harvest strategies:
   proportional harvesting, i.e. removal of a certain proportion of
   individuals in a given age and sex-class, and threshold harvesting, i.e.
   all individuals of a given sex- and age-class are harvested when the
   size of this subpopulation exceeds a certain threshold. In general,
   proportional harvest gives a smaller mean annual yield than threshold
   harvesting. The variance in the annual yield is, however, larger for
   threshold than for proportional harvesting. These differences between
   the two harvest strategies increase when the annual survival of calves
   is low, when there is high environmental stochasticity and when there is
   strong density regulation operating on survival. For both harvest
   strategies, the optimal harvest strategy involves high harvest of calves
   and adult buns, whereas adult females should hardly be harvested.},

Volume = {62},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-279},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Theoretical models, assuming an underlying conflict of interest between
   parents and offspring, suggest that begging can be an honest signal of
   offspring need provided that it is costly. Models on begging have been
   tested primarily on those birds in which parents provide care for
   several offspring. For these species, the underlying conflict selecting
   for extravagant (and apparently costly) begging displays might be
   sibling competition rather than parent-offspring conflict. We tested
   hypotheses on begging and parent-offspring conflict with the grey seal,
   Halichoerus grypus, as our model species, in which lactating females
   care for a single pup. As predicted from models of begging as an honest
   signal of need, pups begged at a significantly higher rate when hungry
   than when satiated. Furthermore, a mother was more likely to approach
   her pup shortly after the pup had uttered a begging call than within a
   randomly chosen period. We found no consistent support, however, for the
   assumption that there are strong conflicts of interest between mothers
   and pups. For example, the rate of suckling was not correlated with
   begging rate suckling bouts terminated by pups were not longer than
   those terminated by mothers, and, although pups initiated the majority
   of suckling bouts, mothers did not terminate more suckling bouts than
   pups. These findings thus suggest that begging in species that care for
   a single offspring may evolve in the absence of strong parent-offspring
   conflict. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Abstract = {To determine the main factors affecting the population dynamics of
   Svalbard reindeer, we analysed 21 yr of annual censuses, including data
   on population size, recruitment rate (calves per female) and mortality
   (number of deaths), from the Reindalen reindeer population. In
   accordance with previous studies on population dynamics of Svalbard
   reindeer, we found large inter-annual variation in population size,
   mortality and recruitment rates within the study area. Population size
   decreased in years with low recruitment rate as well as high winter
   mortality and vice versa. Apparently, the fluctuations were due to both
   direct density-dependent food limitation and variation in winter climate
   associated with high precipitation and icing of the feeding range. We
   found no delayed density-dependence or effect of climatic conditions
   during summer on the population dynamics. The mortality during die-off
   years was mainly of calves and very old individuals, indicating that the
   population was more vulnerable to high die off in years following high
   recruitment rate. These results suggest an unstable interaction between
   the reindeer population and its food supply in these predator-free
   environments.},

Abstract = {Experiments on the corridor function of linear features in real
   landscapes are difficult and expensive to carry out using the classic
   replicated and controlled experimental regimes usually required as
   formal proof of a concept. We describe two experiments using model
   structures to simulate different attributes of hedges for their
   potential role in initiating corridor movement.
   We examined: (i) the visual signal or link provided by flowering plants
   associated with hedges (represented by a narrow red-and-white builder's
   warning tape) and (ii) the physical presence of the body of the hedge
   itself (represented by green horticultural windbreak). Removable, 100 m
   long, links were created between two habitat patches (Angstrom
   kerholmer) in an arable field in Vestby, Norway. We recorded the effect
   of the links on the behaviour of three `species' of the free-flying
   butterfly community of the study area: the scarce copper (Heodes
   virgaureae), the heath fritillary (Mellicta athalia) and, as a complex,
   the high brown (Fabriciana adippe) and niobe fritillaries (F. niobe).
   The visual link did not elicit a uniform response by the different
   `species'. Significantly more high brown/niobe fritillaries flew along
   the visual link than along the control (no link) and mean distances
   traveled along the tape were significantly longer than for the control.
   The heath fritillary and scarce copper did not react in this way. The
   tape had a slight, but statistically significant, barrier effect on the
   scarce copper but did not act as a barrier to the other species.
   All three `species' were strongly affected by the presence of the
   physical link. A significant barrier effect was detected for all three
   `species' as was a corridor effect with an increased proportion of
   butterflies moving along the windbreak compared with the control. Mean
   distances traveled along the windbreak were significantly longer
   compared with the control, the response being strongest for the scarce
   copper.
   The results demonstrated that simple structures could modify the
   behaviour of species moving through the landscape and that individual
   species reacted in different ways to the same structure. The
   experimental approach of using model structures may have promise for
   modeling aspects of landscape elements in natural situations for a range
   of species. The results are discussed in relation to butterfly
   population structure, mate finding, dispersal and corridor design.},

Abstract = {The stomach contents of 2992 wild and 863 putative escaped farmed
   Atlantic salmon caught on floating long-lines in a Faroese research
   fishery in the late autumn (November-December) and winter
   (February-March) in the Northeast Atlantic (63-66 degreesN and 1-10
   degreesW) during three consecutive fishing periods 1991/1993-1994/1995
   were analysed. Hyperiid amphipods of the genus Themisto. euphausiids and
   mesopelagic shrimps are important sources of food for salmon in the
   autumn period and various mesopelagic fish as lantern fishes, pearlsides
   and barracudinas become equally important during the late winter period.
   The occasional presence in the stomach of larger fish such as herring,
   blue whiting and mackerel is not considered to be evidence that these
   fish are a main source of food for salmon in the sea north of the
   Faroes. The proportion of stomachs containing food was significantly
   lower during autumn (53\%) than during winter (78\%). However,
   temperature-dependent evacuation rates could partly explain the apparent
   lower stomach content during the autumn since the average ambient
   sea-surface temperature is 7 degreesC in autumn compared to 3 degreesC
   in winter. There was evidence of selective foraging. Fish were preferred
   over crustaceans, and amphipods were chosen over euphausiids. Large
   salmon (3+SW) tended to be more piscivorous than smaller fish. There was
   no difference in condition factor, number and weight proportions of
   prey, or in diet between wild and escaped farmed salmon, which suggests
   that escaped farmed salmon adapt well to the ``wild{''} life in the
   ocean. (C) 2001 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

Title = {Patterns of incubation and nest-site attentiveness in relation to
   organochlorine (PCB) contamination in glaucous gulls},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Although experimental studies show that organochlorines (OC) can
   affect bird behaviour, field assessments are invariably confounded by
   ecological differences between contaminated and uncontaminated sites.
   The behaviour of individual birds in the field has rarely been related
   to the contaminant burden.
   2. We examined individual patterns of incubation and nest-site
   attentiveness in relation to OC burden, measured as polychlorinated
   biphenyl (PCB) concentration in the blood, of 27 glaucous gulls Larus
   hyperboreus in two breeding areas at Bear Island, in the north-eastern
   Atlantic.
   3. Blood PCB concentrations ranged from 52 ng g(-1) to 1079 ng g(-1)
   (wet weight). There were significant differences between the two
   breeding areas, and females had significantly lower concentrations than
   males.
   4. Gull behaviour differed significantly between breeding areas and
   sexes independently of PCB. Females incubated more than males (54\% vs.
   46\%) but spent more time away from the nest site than males, both
   overall (23\% vs. 12\%) and when not incubating (50\% vs. 21\%). They
   were also absent for longer periods (4.5 vs. 2.8 h). Moreover, length of
   incubation bouts (6.4 vs. 4.4 h), the amount of time absent from the
   nest site when not incubating (51\% vs. 25\%) and length of absences
   (5.6 vs. 1.8 h) differed between breeding areas, probably due to
   different feeding specializations.
   5. After controlling for these area and sex effects, the proportion of
   time absent from the nest site when not incubating, and the number of
   absences, were both significantly related to blood concentration of PCB.
   6. Increased absence from the nest site in individual glaucous gulls
   with high blood concentrations of OC suggests effects on reproductive
   behaviour. We speculate that endocrine disruption or neurological
   effects might be involved, leading to increased energetic costs during
   incubation and reduced reproductive output.},

Abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate that the mountain hare and roe deer
   compete with each other. This was determined using ``natural
   experiments{''} of populations found in sympatry and allopatry on the
   islands along the west coast of Norway. We demonstrate that both species
   occupy the same habitats, share the same food resources and that food
   availability is limited. Two browsing species as different in size as
   roe deer and mountain hare might be expected to partition the available
   vegetation (e.g. woody scrub) in terms of height above ground level.
   However, from the evidence collected, the feeding-height-separation
   hypothesis must be rejected as an explanation for ecological separation
   between roe deer and mountain hares because there was extensive height
   overlap in resource utilisation by both species and neither species
   changed its feeding height in response to the presence of the other.
   Total browse utilisation did not increase when both species were
   together; rather, species-specific browse utilisation declined when the
   other species was present. However, the foraging behaviour of each
   herbivore varied significantly between the allopatric and sympatric
   sites. When both herbivores were present, the clip diameter of shoots
   browsed by mountain hares declined to match those selected by roe deer,
   while roe deer switched from a browse-dominated diet to a diet dominated
   by winter-green gramineae. The change to smaller-diameter shoots likely
   resulted in the hare increasing its intake of digestion-inhibiting or
   toxic secondary metabolites, while the alternative choice of digging
   through the snow like roe deer to reach the wintergreen gramineae is a
   practice considered energetically too costly for hares. On this basis,
   we conclude that the enforced switch to a nutritionally inferior diet by
   mountain hares at the sympatric sites may result in changes to growth
   rate and body size which consequently impact on mortality and may
   explain the competitive superiority of the roe deer.},

Abstract = {Reintroduction of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) after liming of
   acidified barren salmon rivers could benefit by choosing acid tolerant
   strains. Testing different life history stages from fry to smolts of
   five salmon strains with different acidification history demonstrated
   strain-specific variation in tolerance to acid aluminum-rich waters for
   stages from fry to parr. Contrary to expectation, salmon from
   non-acidified rivers were more tolerant. Differences in sensitivity were
   found between life history stages. Within a specific life history stage,
   size-dependent sensitivity was found; small fish being more sensitive to
   pH while large fish were more sensitive to aluminum. Presmolts showed
   the same relative tolerance between strains as younger stages. These
   differences disappeared, however, when the smolt reached fall
   smoltification, probably due to supersensitivity at this stage. Poor
   water quality during the last period of smoltification and outmigration
   can thus mask the genetic potential for tolerance to acidic rivers.},

   lake was limed in autumn 1998. Qualitative nethaul samples from the
   deepest part of the lake and from the most frequent habitat in the
   littoral zone were used. The limed lakes had a species composition which
   indicates that these lakes are about to recover. Species associated with
   neutral lakes dominates while acid-tolerant species were rare. The
   acid-sensitive species, Daphnia longispina and D. cristata, were found

   dominate in acidic water, and may ecologically be equivalent species.
   Sometimes the same species occur at different pH in the two continents.

   and other environmental variables. All acidification variables (pH,

   richness and composition. The variation in microcrustacean richness was
   best explained by the combination of dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   fish species richness and lake area. Of 16 variables tested, pH showed
   strongest correlation with the main gradient in the crustacean
   composition explaining between 13 and 16\% of the variance in the
   species data (CCA). pH, elevation, lake area, average depth, DOC,
   conductivity and fish species richness explained 30-54\% of the total
   variance. Stronger correlation was obtained between species composition
   and environmental data in analyses which included the between-year
   differences than analyses based on the cumulative species records.
   Analyses based on the pelagic species exclusively gave similarly
   stronger correlation than analyses based on all crustacean species.
   Small changes in the species composition during the three years of study
   may be an indication of recovery of microcrustaceans in Killarney lakes.},

Abstract = {In order to test whether major reductions in acid inputs had improved
   water quality sufficiently for fish populations to recover, we stocked
   wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) in three highly acidified lakes
   that had previously supported this species, and in one limed lake. The
   fish, which were introduced from a local lake (donor lake), generally
   rangers from 12 to 16 cm in total length, and were stocked at densities
   of 117-177 fish ha(-1). The untreated lakes were highly acid, with
   minimum pH values and maximum inorganic aluminium concentrations (Al)
   during the spring of 4.6-4.7 and 118-151 mug L-1 respectively. In the
   limed lake, the corresponding values for pH and Al-i ranged between 5.8
   and 6.6 and 5 and 19 mug L-1 respectively. Gill-netting in two
   subsequent years after the introduction yielded only a few recruits (0+)
   and one adult in one of the three acidified lakes in one year only.

Abstract = {The potential use of the metal binding protein metallothionein (MT) as a
   biomarker for trace metal exposure has been evaluated in brown trout
   (Salmo trutta) from the Cu-contaminated Rugla and the Cd/Zn-contaminated
   Naustebekken Norwegian rivers, as well as in hatchery control trout.
   Metal concentrations were measured in gills, liver and kidney as well as
   in ambient water, and compared with Cd/Zn MT and Cu MT levels, measured
   by two Cd-saturation techniques. In addition haematocrit, plasma
   chloride and condition factors (weight x 100/length(3)) were measured,
   and genetic diversity determined. A negative correlation was found
   between the Cd/Zn MT content and the condition factor in the different
   trout populations, and Naustebekken trout, having the lowest condition
   factor, were less heterozygous than Rugla trout, indicating that
   Naustebekken trout have adapted to the metal in their environment.
   Significant positive correlations were found between accumulated levels
   of Cd and Cd/Zn MT in liver and kidney, suggesting that liver and
   kidney, but not gill, Cd/Zn MT can be used as a biomarker for chronic Cd
   exposure. Cu MT seems less suitable as a biomarker for Cu exposure.
   These data together further emphasize that MTs must be applied with
   caution, when assessing these proteins in biomonitoring of the natural
   environment.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed for 36 days to water from the
   acidified (pH 5.2) Fossbekk River (Norway) with 50 mug.L-1 of aluminium
   (Al) added as AlCl3, or to circumneutral water (pH 6.6) from Ims River
   (Norway), Food consumption, cardiac output, swimming activity, and
   growth rate were measured to determine the effects of sublethal levels
   of Al in acidic water on the bioenergetics of the fish. Food consumption
   was reduced in acidic water and Al during the first 12 days, but was not
   significantly different from the control group during the rest of the
   exposure. A significant decrease in body weight was concomitant with the
   reduction in food consumption. The fish also kept losing weight during
   the rest of the exposure despite the return of their appetite to normal.
   Cardiac output of the fish exposed to acidic water and Al was not
   significantly different from the control group after 36 days of
   exposure. Swimming activity remained significantly elevated throughout
   the exposure to acidic water and Al. These results indicate that
   sublethal levels of Al can alter the energy budget of Atlantic salmon
   living in acidified surface waters, (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of copper, zinc, cadmium, selenium and mercury were
   determined in eggs, muscle, liver, kidney and stomach content of
   nestlings and adults of the Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica antarctica,
   and its predator, the south polar skua, Chataracta maccormicki, from
   Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. The dominant food of the
   petrels is krill, Euphausia superba. The results show relatively high
   levels of cadmium in krill, which is assumed to be the main reason for
   the high levels of cadmium in petrels and skuas. Cadmium is almost
   absent in eggs, but accumulates very rapidly with age in nestlings. The
   copper concentrations in livers of nestling petrels reach very high
   levels during growth. This may be seen in connection with physiological
   development processes. Mercury seems to be accumulated with age and
   between trophic levels. Among the nestlings, the mercury levels decrease
   with increasing age, which may be accomplished by the excretion of
   mercury through the growth of feathers and as a dilution effect during
   growth. Selenium and mercury are inversely correlated in nestlings. The
   levels of zinc were similar for different nestling stages and between
   nestlings and adults in skuas and petrels. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {We investigated the distribution of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus
   tarandus) from aerial surveys in 1986-1998 in 622 contiguous 4-km(2)
   grid squares in relation to density of power lines, roads and ski trails
   in the Nordfjella region, south-central Norway. Density of reindeer was
   significantly lower in developed quadrats compared to undeveloped
   quadrats and decreased with increasing density of development. No
   reindeer were observed in areas exceeding 1.3 km/km(2) of linear
   structures and only 1.1\% of the reindeer were observed in areas
   exceeding 0.8 km/km(2) of linear structures, an area constituting 17\%
   of the study area. The results imply that development, and also the
   degree of development, affect the availability of range for wild
   reindeer. Furthermore. the results suggest that reindeer may abandon
   areas once disturbance exceeds a critical level. We conclude that there
   is a need for cumulative impact assessments of the overall development
   in Norwegian mountain regions, to preserve the last remaining wild
   reindeer populations in Europe.},

Volume = {99},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The number of ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus and L. mutus) killed along
   three power-line sections through colliding with the overhead wires was
   recorded over a B-year period in a subalpine habitat in southern Norway.
   The effect of an experimental removal of the power-line earth wire
   (common neutral) was evaluated on one of the power-line sections, by
   comparing the number of mortalities found before removal with the number
   found afterwards. The two other power-line sections in the same area
   were used as control sections. The number of collisions was
   approximately halved after the Lower earth wire was removed, thus
   confirming the expectation that there is a connection between the number
   of overhead wire levels (vertically) and the collision rate. The results
   from this and earlier studies indicate that a reduction in overhead wire
   levels has a general positive effect by reducing the collision rate. The
   power companies should develop alternative engineering designs and
   critically assess constructing power lines with continuous earth wires.

Abstract = {Annual and seasonal home ranges were calculated for 47 Eurasian lynx in
   four Scandinavian study sites (two in Sweden and two in Norway). The
   observed home ranges were the largest reported for the species, with
   study site averages ranging from 600 to 1400 km(2) for resident males
   and from 300 to 800 km(2) for resident females. When home range sizes
   were compared to the size of protected areas (national parks and nature
   reserves) in Scandinavia, it was concluded that very few protected areas
   contained sufficient forest to provide space for more than a few
   individuals. As a direct consequence of this, most lynx need to be
   conserved in the multiuse seminatural forest habitats that cover large
   areas in Scandinavia. This conservation strategy leads to a number of
   conflicts with some land uses (sheep and semidomestic reindeer herding,
   and roe deer hunters), but not all (forestry and moose harvest).
   Accordingly research must be aimed at understanding the ecology of these
   conflicts, and finding solutions.},

Abstract = {1. Brown Trout Salmo trutta L. life-history traits were studied in 17
   coastal streams with mean annual water discharges less than or equal to1
   m(3) s(-1), and with anadromous and freshwater resident trout present in
   all streams.
   2. Mean smolt length and age were positively correlated with mean annual
   water discharge and latitude. The variation (CV) in smolt length and age
   was negatively correlated with water discharge. Mean length and age at
   maturity were also positively correlated with mean annual water
   discharge.
   3. Freshwater resident females were sparse (mean: 3.7\%) but males were
   abundant in all the investigated populations (mean 48.9\%). Mean body
   length at maturity of resident males increased with discharge in
   parallel to that of the anadromous males. Mean length at maturity
   increased with smolt length in anadromous males, but not females. Mean
   sea-age at maturity in females, but not males, was negatively correlated
   with smolt age.
   4. It is concluded that several life-history traits of Brown Trout are
   strongly influenced by habitat variables associated with the size of

Abstract = {The diet of post-smelt Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, caught in the

   estuary had eaten intertidal gammarid amphipods. while post-smelts
   caught further seawards preyed upon available marine prey such as
   Calanus spp., adult euphausiids and fish larvae. The frequency of adult
   insects was high in all post-smelt stomachs. The gradual change in diet
   suggested that feeding conditions in the early marine phase were
   important for post-smelt survival and growth. With the exception of the
   copepods, there was no overall similarity between species composition of
   the plankton samples and the stomach contents. Although the hypothesis
   that the post-smolts are opportunistic feeders cannot be rejected, the
   composition of the stomach contents suggests a possible selectivity of

Abstract = {Current interest in small-scale species dynamics has led to a
   proliferation of mobility indices. We advocate the use of direct
   measures of mobility such as immigration rate, extinction rate,
   residence time. and carousel time, We also demonstrate that the null
   expectation of cumulative frequency under different null models can be
   calculated explicitly. Species can depart from the commonly-used `random
   reassignment' model simply because of longevity. and not mobility per
   se. We therefore prefer a random immigration null model, which assumes
   that immigration locations are randomized,
   We examined mobility patterns of selected plant species. studied in 256
   quadrats of each of four grains (ranging from 1/64 m(2) to 1 m(2)) in an
   Oklahoma grassland. Residence times and carousel times can be centuries
   or even millennia for some species, We explore the numerical and
   biological reasons for relationships between mobility statistics.
   Mobility statistics are fairly consistent among grains and years,
   although the residence times of species exhibit some subtle scale
   dependence. Species depart from a random immigration model very slightly
   - but the departure is consistent: species tend to re-occupy previously
   vacated space more often than expected due to chance. We believe that
   the use of direct indices will facilitate the study of how species
   characteristics influence mobility.},

Abstract = {Stability of trichustrogylid populations indicates that some form of
   density-dependent regulation occurs which could act through fecundity.
   We present evidence for intraspecific density-dependent effects in 1 of
   2, dominant, abomasal nematodes species (Ostertagia gruchneri) of
   Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrynchus). We found evidence in
   O. gruehnei, for density-dependent regulation of female worm length in
   April, July and October 1999. However, it is only in July that female
   worm length explains the variation in the number of eggs in utero which
   is also related to egg production per female worm only in this month and
   not at other times of the gear. The seasonal pattern in faecal egg
   output in this species focuses egg production in the summer months when
   conditions are favourable to transmission. In contrast, we found no
   evidence in the other common species (Marshallagia,marshalli) for
   density-dependent regulation of female worm length during or the number
   of eggs in vitro. Faecal egg output in M., marshalli was positively
   related to worm burden but not to the mean number of eggs in utero.
   neither inter-specific interactions nor host body condition appeared to
   influence worm fecundity. The contrasting patterns of density-dependent
   regulation of fecundity provides further evidence for divergent
   life-histories in this nematode community.},

Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {128},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {197-205},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In spite of numerous experimental studies, it has, so far, not been
   possible to link historic changes in forest growth to acid deposition at
   regional scales, partly due to difficulties in modeling the ecological
   complexity of forests. We analyzed radial increment data from increment
   cores from > 31 000 spruce forest plots in southern Norway from
   1954-1996. Using a combination of a bio-stratification model to control
   confounding factors, and a catchment model for acidification, we
   demonstrate for the first time a spatial and temporal co-variation
   between forest growth and both nitrogen deposition and acidification, as
   indicated by acidity critical loads exceedances. Increases in growth
   during the 1960-1970s, followed by a subsequent decline in the
   1980-1990s, were best explained by combined actions of acidification,
   nitrogen deposition and climatic stress on forest growth. While forest
   conditions vary primarily with natural growing conditions, the results
   suggest that boreal forests are sensitive to moderate levels of nitrogen
   and sulphur deposition where acidity critical loads are low, and that
   effects may be observed over relatively short time scales.},

Abstract = {There are only a few recent studies that have demonstrated senescence in
   ungulates and nothing is known regarding how patterns of senescence may
   vary as a:function of density Senescence in general is linked to the
   cost of reproduction, which probably increases with density in ungulates
   and may differ between the sexes. Further, senescence in ungulates is
   also regarded to be a function of tooth wear rates. As density
   dependence and sexual differences in food choice have been well
   documented? this ma); lead to different tooth wear rates and! thus,
   possibly density-dependent and sex-specific patterns of senescence. We
   therefore investigated the effects of age, sex, density and-their
   possible interactions on the variability of body weight in 29 047 red
   deer harvested during 1965-1998 from Norway, out of which 380 males and
   1452 females were eight years or older. There was clear evidence that
   spatio-temporal variation in density correlated negatively with body
   weights. In addition, there was evidence of senescence in both male and
   female red deer. Age at onset of senescence in females was after 20
   years of age and independent of population density. In males, the onset
   and rate of senescence increased with increasing population density The
   onset of senescence for males was at ca. 12 years of age at low density,
   but decreased to approximately ten years of age at high density The
   pattern of density-dependent senescence in males, but not that in
   females, can be explained if (i) the cost of reproduction increases with
   density more strongly in male than in female red deer, and/or (ii) tooth
   wear rates are density dependent in males, but not in females. We
   discuss the ability of these two different, not mutually exclusive
   hypotheses in explaining the observed pattern of senescence.},

Abstract = {In order to examine if whole blood concentrations of organochlorines
   (OCs) is an appropriate dosimetric parameter for use in ecotoxicological
   studies of free-living birds, a number of incubating glaucous gulls
   (Larus hyperboreus) were repeatedly sampled within and between
   subsequent breeding seasons. The wet weight concentrations of selected
   OCs, differing in persistence and fat solubility, were compared and it
   was assessed to what extent present concentrations could be predicted
   from concentrations previously measured in the individuals. There were
   only a few significant differences in the blood concentrations of the
   selected OCs within and between seasons. The most persistent compound,
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153, showed a low interindividual
   variability, and between seasons, 70\% of the variance could be
   explained by the level in the previous year, while changes in body
   condition and blood lipid percentage were of less importance. For
   PCB-101, the predictability of the present blood concentration from the
   previous concentration was lower than for PCB-153, and changes in body
   condition and blood lipid percentage explained a higher proportion of
   the variance. The present level, of alpha -hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)
   could not be predicted from the previous level. Sex did not explain any
   significant proportion of the variance in OC concentrations when
   previous level and changes in body mass and blood lipid were included in
   the statistical models. Thus, for the most persistent OCs, concentration
   in the blood of incubating glaucous gulls is representative for the
   interindividual differences over time and whole blood concentrations of
   OCs appear adequate as a dose metric in ecotoxicological studies.},

Abstract = {A 7 year study (1992-1998) of littoral microcrustaceans (Cladocera and
   Copepoda) in the watercourse of the River Rore, South Norway,
   illustrates that qualitative data on cladocerans and copepods are well
   suited to indicate the recovery of lakes following liming. Eight limed,
   two acid and two circum neutral reference lakes, were sampled twice a
   year (June/July and September/October). In the limed lakes, species
   associated with neutral lakes have become more common, whereas
   apparently acid-tolerant species have become rarer. In Lake Rore and
   Lake Syndle, the two largest limed lakes which exhibited a gradual
   increase in pH, the changes in species composition indicated that these
   lakes were about to recover. Species composition in Lake Roynelandsvatn,
   which has reacidified after liming, first reflected improved water
   quality, then reverted to dominance by acid-tolerant species. In the
   remaining lakes, the species composition reflects a fauna which has
   recovered compared with the preliming situation. There is strong
   evidence, however, that temporary fluctuations in pH have a negative
   influence on the speed of recovery, confirming the importance of keeping
   pH stable.},

Title = {Nonlinear effects of large-scale climatic variability on wild and

Journal = {NATURE},

Volume = {410},

Pages = {1096-1099},

Abstract = {Large-scale climatic fluctuations, such as the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO)(1,2), have been shown to affect many ecological
   processes(3-6). Such effects have been typically assumed to be linear.
   Only one study has reported a nonlinear relation(7); however, that
   nonlinear relation was monotonic (that is, no reversal). Here we show
   that there is a strong nonlinear and non-monotonic (that is, reversed)
   effect of the NAO on body weight during the subsequent autumn for 23,838
   individual wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 139,485 individual
   domestic sheep (Ovis aries) sampled over several decades on the west
   coast of Norway. These relationships are, at least in part, explained by
   comparable nonlinear and nonmonotonic relations between the NAO and
   local climatic variables (temperature, precipitation and snow depth).
   The similar patterns observed for red deer and sheep, the latter of
   which live indoors during winter and so experience a stable energy
   supply in winter, suggest that the (winter) climatic variability (for
   which the index is a proxy) must influence the summer foraging
   conditions directly or indirectly.},

Abstract = {Artificial culture may relax the selective pressures from predators,
   thereby altering behavioural and heart rate responses to predation risk.
   Culture may also impose new selection that adapts fish to confinement.
   Predictions from these hypotheses were tested by comparing
   seventh-generation farm Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with wild Atlantic
   salmon from the principal founder population of the farm strain. Wild
   age 1+ salmon had higher standard heart rates and showed a more
   pronounced flight and heart rate response to a simulated predator attack
   than did farmed salmon. However, wild fish were closer to the model
   predator at attack, which may have accentuated these differences. Both
   strains habituated to the threat, showing less response to the second
   attack than to the first. In contrast with age 1+ fish, wild age 2+
   salmon had lower standard heart rates than farmed fish. Moreover, in age
   2+ salmon, domestication effects were less clear and the response to
   predation threat considerably weaker, suggesting that environmental
   effects of culture override genetic effects as time in captivity
   increases. Domestication selection may thus alter reaction norms of
   farmed animals over environmental gradients and time. This should be
   considered when attempting to predict the consequences of release or
   escape of domesticated animals in the wild.},

Abstract = {Anadromous juvenile Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) were caught in the
   Sila River (66 degrees 21'N, 13 degrees 10'E, Nordland County, Norway)
   by use of a fish trap during their migration towards the sea in
   May/June. The absence of tags (not captured before) and examination of
   otoliths from sacrificed fish revealed that none of the experimental
   charr had previously encountered seawater. During 4 days of exposure to
   seawater, only minor changes in blood plasma osmolality, and blood
   plasma concentrations of Na+, Cl- and Mg2+ were detected. An increase in
   Na+-K+-ATPase activity was measured during the exposure period. These
   results verified that first-time migrants exhibit hypoosmoregulatory
   capacity similar to that of smoltified Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
   Accordingly, the Arctic charr first-time migratory behaviour, including
   late descent and a possible stay within an estuary, cannot be taken as
   evidence of a poorly developed seawater tolerance.},

Abstract = {Mothers are predicted to invest in their offspring depending on the
   quality of their mate, their opportunity to invest in future
   reproduction and the characteristics of the habitat in which their
   offspring will be born. Recent studies have suggested a transfer of
   maternal immunity to offspring as an induced response to the local
   presence of parasites in the environment, but evidence has been
   indirect. Here, we show the presence of antibodies against the Lyme
   disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato; a spirochaete transmitted
   by the seabird tick Ixodes uriae, in the eggs of kittiwakes Rissa
   tridactyla. We report higher prevalence of antibodies against Borrelia
   in eggs from breeding areas with higher prevalence and abundance of
   ticks. Further, high repeatabilities of antibody-positive eggs within
   clutches and between first and replacement clutches show that, within a
   breeding season, females differ consistently with respect to the
   expression of this induced maternal response. Our results suggest that
   mothers can alter investment in their young depending on local
   conditions. Such maternal effects clearly have implications for the
   ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions.},

Abstract = {To examine how Steller's eiders, Polysticta stelleri, wintering at 70
   degreesN cope with adverse winter conditions in terms of darkness and
   low temperatures, we studied their feeding behaviour during four periods
   between late autumn and early spring. Steller's eiders were most likely
   to feed during daylight and twilight, but they also fed during darkness.
   The incidence of feeding was highest at low tide, and there was a
   significant interaction between tidal cycle and winter period. Hence,
   the birds fed more intensively at low tide in midwinter (January) than
   during the other periods. Air temperatures were between 8 and 10
   degreesC lower in midwinter than during the other periods, and during
   this period the eiders also fed more by means of nondiving techniques
   (up-ending, surface feeding). The total estimated feeding time was
   highest in late autumn and midwinter (5.9 and 6.3 h were spent actively
   feeding, respectively) and lower in late winter and spring (5.1 and 4.6
   h, respectively). Thus, as energy requirements increased as a result of
   low temperatures, Steller's eiders increased their feeding effort, but
   also reduced feeding costs by reducing diving depth. The results of this
   study suggest that the Steller's eider is behaviourally well adapted to
   survive winter at high latitudes at relatively low stress.},

Title = {Adaptive precocial reproduction in voles: reproductive costs and
   multivoltine life-history strategies in seasonal environments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {191-200},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {1. We determined whether reproductive costs associated with precocious
   or later breeding by female Townsend's voles (Microtus townsendii)
   differ and how this relates to the multivoltine life history of
   microtines. We related the probability of mothers surviving the
   lactation period to maternal age and the number of pups per litter using
   logistic models allowing for a threshold value in either explanatory
   variable below (for litter size) and above (for age) which survival is
   constant.
   2. Females born at the beginning of the breeding period were precocious,
   giving birth for the first time by the time they were 85 days old (min
   38 days). Females born at other times delayed sexual maturation by up to
   6 months.
   3. The survival of females who gave birth before a fitted threshold of
   85 days old declined precipitously if they gave birth to more than five
   pups per litter. Survival of older females did not vary in relation to
   the size of their litters.
   4. Precocious females had not reached adult size when they conceived
   their first litter and substantially increased their structural mass
   during pregnancy. We estimated that young primiparous females gained on
   average 127 +/- 9\% of their conception weight during their 21-day first
   pregnancy compared to an average increase of 47 +/- 2\% per pregnancy
   for all other females. It appears that the low survival during lactation
   experienced by this cohort alone may be a consequence of the cumulative
   costs of gestation, lactation and somatic growth.
   5. We build simple life-table models to estimate the contribution of
   very precocious (conception at 25 days), precocious (conception at 50
   days) and non-precocious females (conception > 50 days) to the
   population as the probability of surviving the spring and summer, plus
   the total number of females produced and surviving until the end of the
   summer. We parameterized such models using the empirical survival
   estimates. Females who conceived five young very precociously made the
   greatest contribution to the autumn population. Delaying reproduction
   had a large cost: a very precocious female starting with five young
   would contribute 7.21 females, while a precocious female with the same
   initial litter size would contribute only 2.83 females. This advantage
   stems from both the longer breeding-life span and from the fact that
   offspring of very precocious females may themselves reproduce in the
   year of their birth, such that they compound the precocious investment
   of their mothers.
   6. Thus iterated reproduction and the multivoltine nature of microtine
   life history select for cohort-specific trade-off between survival and
   reproduction.},

Abstract = {The Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus exhibits 1-4 sympatric morphs in
   postglacial lakes, of which one or two are epibenthic zoobenthos
   feeders, one is a limnetic planktivore and one is a piscivorous form. In
   addition, northern rivers support partly migratory populations with
   anadromous and freshwater resident fish. The morphs vary in their
   coloration, morphology, life history, behaviour and genetic
   characteristics. The morphs usually differentiate according to their
   ontogenetic stage at maturity, which parallels paedomorphism in
   amphibians. The young usually start as epibenthic zoobenthivores, but
   may become pelagic at a certain size according to the predation risk
   experienced at that time. From a length of >20-25 cm, charr start to
   become piscivorous. The proportion of piscivorous fish increases with
   increasing body size. In partly anadromous populations. fish that mature
   before smelling become freshwater resident, the others anadromous. In
   some rivers, the morphs occupy separate niches (epibenthic and
   limnetic), from emergence onwards. The morphs exhibit different degrees
   of reproductive isolation that vary from a high degree of interbreeding
   to complete isolation. Usually, they spawn within morph (assortative:
   mating). but alternative male mating behaviour (sneaking, fighting) may
   occur in stream-spawning populations and at great depths in lakes.
   Morphologically specialized morphs appear to Feed more effectively than
   intermediate forms. and selection according to feeding mode, site
   fidelity and associated assortative mating are prerequisites for the
   evolution of the different morphs. Charr morphs develop into stable
   feeding niches under conditions of intense intraspecific competition
   when there is little competition with other species. Sympatric morphs
   exhibit different degrees of speciation but similar morphs in different
   systems are not individual species because of (1) their polyphyletic
   origin, (2) the supporting systems are often young, transient
   environments making the future situation for the populations uncertain.
   and (3) the genetic differentiation among morphs is low. Sympatric
   morphs may interbreed and produce fertile hybrids. Nevertheless,
   sympatric charr morphs should be managed as separate species. Changes in
   the natural conditions or human impacts to which the morphs are adapted
   will have a strong influence on the persistence and survival of each
   different morph. (C) 2001 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Abstract = {Use of radiotelemetry may affect the behavior pattern of an animal and
   thus the usefulness of telemetry data. Therefore, in 1994-1996, we
   investigated subsequent use of capture patches (i.e., a circular area
   around a capture site with a radius equal to the mean minimum daily
   distance moved by the lynx in question) for 9 Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx).
   We wanted to investigate possible effects of the capture event (i.e.,
   the process of capturing, processing, and releasing a lynx) on
   subsequent movement patterns of captured animals. Use of capture patches
   relative to use of other equally sized, randomly selected patches of
   similar habitat within the home range did not differ. The only possible
   effect on the telemetry data from this study was the significantly
   (P=0.028) longer time before lynx returned to the capture patch compared
   to other parches. This may result from a combination of a temporary
   effect of the capture event, effects of seasonal changes, and changes in
   the age and status of the animal in question. Further studies on effect
   of the capture event on the subsequent movement patterns of wild animals
   should concentrate on use of recapture patches before and after
   recapture, as this approach Will allow comparison of use of capture
   patches before and after a capture event.},

Abstract = {Despite more than 69 years of protection populations of arctic fox
   (Alopex lagopus) in Scandinavia has not recovered their former numbers
   or distribution Following over-hunting at the turn of the century. We
   aimed to evaluate the possible fate of arctic fox populations using
   discrete-time models including both demographic and environmental
   variability. Because the reproduction of arctic fox in Scandinavia is
   dependent on the abundance of small rodents, which is cyclic, we
   included the temporal variability of reproductive performances in our
   viability analysis based on time series available for three Scandinavian
   populations. Whatever the modelling of the reproductive performances and
   the range of adult survival rates considered, the risks of extinction
   were high. They were very sensitive to adult survival rates and
   variability in reproductive performances. Populations with the longest
   duration between two successful reproductions were at the greatest risks
   of extinction. The time elapsed between two successful reproductions may
   depend on Failure to respond to rodent peaks. The cyclicity of food
   availability for arctic fox may have been the main selective force for
   their large litter size, but may also be the cause of a fine-tuned, and
   fragile dynamic system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {We analyzed 136 time series (covering from 44 to 73 yr) of juvenile cod
   to estimate the level of direct and delayed density-dependent mortality
   (DDM) of 11 populations from the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. The
   parameters were estimated using a modeling approach that explicitly
   incorporates observation errors, so that we could quantify the
   density-independent (stochastic) variation in the survival of juvenile
   cod. Moderate to strong levels of DDM (direct or delayed) were estimated
   in eight of the 11 populations. Variability in the 0-group (corrected
   for observation errors) appeared to be large for most of the
   populations. Substantial stochastic variability in postsettlement
   survival was also detected in some areas, indicating that stochastic
   factors are not only important for egg and larval stages, as stated by
   the match-mismatch hypothesis, but also for juveniles. We show that the
   variability in these coastal populations is not only regulated as a
   function of the strength of DDM processes, but also as an interaction
   between DDM processes and stochastic factors. We finally postulate that
   local and regional differences in the strengths of the density-dependent
   and stochastic processes are related to differences in the quantity and
   quality of the bottom flora coverage, which govern both food
   availability and shelter for juveniles.},

Title = {Functional models for growth and food consumption of Atlantic salmon
   parr, Salmo salar, from a Norwegian river},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-186},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. The chief objectives were to analyse and model experimental data for
   maximum growth and food consumption of Atlantic salmon parr (Salmo
   salar) collected from a cold glacier fed river in western Norway. The
   growth and feeding models were also applied to groups of Atlantic salmon
   growing and feeding at rates below the maximum. The growth models were
   validated by comparing their predictions with observed growth in the
   river supplying the experimental fish.
   2. Two different models were fitted, one originally developed for
   British salmon and the other based on a model for bacterial growth. Both
   gave estimates for optimum temperature for growth at 18-19 degreesC,
   somewhat higher than for Atlantic salmon from Britain. Higher optimal
   temperature for growth in salmon from a cold Norwegian river than from
   British rivers does not concur with predictions from the thermal
   adaptation hypothesis.
   3. Model parameter estimates differed among growth groups in that the
   lower critical temperature for growth increased from fast to slow
   growing individuals. In contrast to findings for brown trout (Salmo
   trutta), the optimum temperature for growth did not decrease with
   decreasing levels of food consumption.
   4. A new and simple model showed that food consumption (expressed in
   energy terms) peaked at 19.5-19.8 degreesC, which is similar to the
   optimal temperature for growth. Feeding began at a temperature 1.5
   degreesC below the lower temperature for growth and ended about 1
   degreesC above the maximum temperature for growth. Model parameter
   estimates for consumption differed among growth groups in a manner
   similar to the growth models. Maximum consumption was lower for Atlantic
   salmon than for brown trout, except at temperatures above 18 degreesC.
   5. By combining the growth and food consumption models, growth
   efficiency was estimated and reached a maximum at about 14 degreesC for
   fast growing individuals, increasing to nearly 17 degreesC for slow
   growing ones, although it was lower overall for the latter group.
   Efficiency also declined with increasing fish size. Growth efficiency
   was generally higher for Atlantic salmon than for brown trout,
   particularly at high temperature.},

Title = {Nest attendance and foraging movements of northern fulmars rearing

Abstract = {We studied several aspects of the foraging ecology of fulmars rearing
   young chicks on Bjornoya. To determine precisely the duration of
   foraging trips during the brooding period, we used an automated logging
   system that recorded the presence of fulmars fitted with transponders.
   We also tracked, with satellite transmitters, four parent fulmars during
   the brooding period, and two after the chick had been left alone. When
   brooding the chick, fulmars appeared to alternate very rapidly on the
   nest, with foraging trips lasting on average 8 h. This period appeared
   constraining for the birds since parents lost mass. The growth of chicks
   was dependent on the ability of the female land not the male) to do
   short foraging trips. At this time birds are foraging at an average
   distance of 60 km from the colony, with birds concentrating on the shelf
   around Bjornoya. They did not return from one trip to the next to the
   same foraging area. As the season progressed and the chicks were left
   alone on the nest, parents increased the duration and maximum range of
   foraging trips as well as the distance covered. However, they still
   perform a succession of relatively short foraging trips to the east of
   the Bjornoya shelf but they interspersed these short trips with longer
   foraging trips. One bird returned twice to the same site along the
   Norwegian coast 570 km from Bjornoya, the other foraged at 580 km in the
   mid-Barents Sea. Average flight speed including time spent on the water
   was 28 km/h and reached 70 km/h during bouts of more than 1 h when the
   bird was probably continuously in fight.},

Pages = {86-94},
Abstract = {Five hundred and sixty-two children and adolescents, aged between nine
   and 15 years, from one urban and three rural areas in Southern Norway,
   completed a questionnaire in which they expressed their degree of
   preference for various animal species, participation In animal-related
   activities, and the presence of pets at home. The results showed that a
   majority of the respondents had an animal at home (71\%), and
   participated in animal-related activities such as fishing (72\%),
   feeding birds (74\%), and reading about animals (66\%). Participation in
   most animal-related activities decreased with increasing age. Pet owners
   liked farm and wild animals more than did respondents without pets.
   Positive associations were found between the liking of animal species
   and participation in animal-related activities. Gender differences were
   largest for horseback riding (girls most) and for fishing and hunting
   (boys most). Those who reported allergic reactions to animals, or had
   been injured by an animal, liked animals as much as, or more than, did
   the other respondents. (C) 2001 International Society for Anthrozoology.},

Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wolverine (Gulo gulo) numbers in Scandinavia were significantly reduced
   during the early part of the century as a result of predator removal
   programmes and hunting. Protective legislation in both Sweden and Norway
   in the 1960s and 1970s has now resulted in increased wolverine densities
   in Scandinavia. We report here the development of 15 polymorphic
   microsatellite markers in wolverine and their use to examine the
   population sub-structure and genetic variability in free-ranging
   Scandinavian wolverine populations as well as in a sample of individuals
   collected before 1970. Significant subdivision between extant
   populations was discovered, in particular for the small and isolated
   population of southern Norway which represents a recent recolonization.
   Overall genetic variability was found to be,lower than previously
   reported for other mustelids, with only two to five alleles per locus
   and observed heterozygosities (H-o) ranging from 0.269 to 0.376 across
   the examined populations, being lowest in southern Norway Analysis of
   the mitochondrial DNA control region revealed no variation throughout
   the surveyed populations. As the historical sample did not show higher
   levels of genetic variability, our results are consistent with a
   reduction in the genetic variation in Scandinavian wolverines that
   pre-dates the demographic bottleneck observed during the last century.
   The observed subdivision between populations calls for management
   caution when issuing harvest quotas, especially for the geographically
   isolated south Norwegian population.},

Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {261-268},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {. It is remarkable that after many thousands of years of pastoralism in
   arid and semi-arid savannas, there is still no clear answer to the basic
   question: Does livestock grazing have more than a marginal effect on the
   dynamics of arid and semi-arid land vegetation? A small study of
   semi-arid savanna vegetation along a spatial gradient in grazing
   pressure, repeated three times over 19 years is used as a basis for
   discussing the behaviour of dry land vegetation under heavy grazing.
   Three basic theories are compared: (1) the theory that heavy grazing
   causes desertification; (2) the theory that heavy grazing causes no
   directed change in the vegetation of arid and semi-arid rangelands; and
   (3) the theory that heavy grazing leads to a switch between alternative
   states of vegetation. On the basis of the current data the first two
   theories are rejected, but the conclusion is that there is much evidence
   for a more complex behaviour of dry rangelands under grazing than what
   is accommodated in any of the three theories. Probably, site-specific
   properties including interactive and indirect effects of herbivory in
   the system are important for vegetation development under grazing in
   arid and semi-arid rangelands.},

Volume = {71},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Erwin's much debated estimate of 30 million species of arthropods is
   revised. The original estimate is based on the evaluation of host
   specificity of guilds in beetle samples, and subsequent hierarchical
   ratio extrapolations. The growing number of studies including mass
   sampling of arthropods have provided several data sets suitable for
   obtaining an empirical basis of this estimate. The structure in this
   modified version is somewhat changed compared to the original estimate
   in order to make each hierarchical step more easily testable. Plant
   species are separated into different growth forms, and host specificity
   measures are based only on phytophagous species. Effective
   specialization is applied as a measure of host specificity to correct
   for the fauna shared between plant species. A between community
   correction factor is applied to correct for differences in host
   specificity at different spatial scales. There are still great
   uncertainties attended with such estimates. The largest problems refer
   to the between community correction factor and the proportion of canopy
   species to total species. Further work on host specificity and the least
   known hyperdiverse groups are also needed. The revised version of the
   estimate does not support hyperestimates of 30-100 million species.
   Rather, it compares nicely with estimates derivied from other estimation
   methods, indicating a global arthropod species richness of 5-10 million
   species. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.},

Abstract = {To study the diving activity of harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) from
   nursing to independent feeding, we VHF radio tagged and tracked seven
   pups. The pups gradually developed the diving skills necessary to obtain
   enough food alter weaning and to avoid natural and man-made dangers. The
   maximum dive duration remained unchanged with pup age, indicating that
   pups have considerable breath-holding capacity already from an early
   age. However, mean dive duration increased with age, from 0.92 min in
   pups less than or equal to 25 days old to 2.55 min in 1-2 month olds,
   and 3.09 min in 2-3 month olds. The increase continued for weeks after
   the assumed weaning, and indicates that the capacity to perform
   long-lasting dives steadily increases as the pups grow older. Mean and
   maximum surface duration remained unchanged with pup age. Mean surface
   duration was 0.33 min with a maximum value of 6.10 min. An increase in
   mean surface duration with mean dive duration was found when the pups
   were less than or equal to 25 days old, but not when they were older.
   This may indicate that young pulps need to rest more after diving than
   older ones. No relationship was found btween dive duration and the
   subsequent surface interval. The proportion of time spent submerged
   increased with age, from 71\% when the pups were less than or equal to
   25 days old to 86\% when they were older. The pups hauled-out less
   frequently as they grew older. The pups were never recorded outside the
   study area (defined by the 30-km station range). Time of day, tidal
   height and weather conditions seemed not to influence the diving
   behaviour of the pups. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Northern vole populations exhibit large-scale, spatially synchronous
   population dynamics(1,2). Such cases of population synchrony provide
   excellent opportunities for distinguishing between local intrinsic and
   regional extrinsic mechanisms of population regulation(3). Analyses of
   large-scale survey data and theoretical modelling(4-6) have indicated
   several plausible synchronizing mechanisms. It is difficult, however, to
   determine the most important one without detailed data on local
   demographic processes(3,7). Here we combine results from two field
   studies in southeastern Norway-one identifies local demographic
   mechanisms and landscape-level annual synchrony among 28 enclosed
   experimental populations and the other examines region-level
   multi-annual synchrony in open natural populations. Despite fences
   eliminating predatory mammals and vole dispersal, the growth rates of
   the experimental populations were synchronized and moreover, perfectly
   linked with vole abundance in the region. The fates of 481 radio-marked
   voles showed that bird predation was the synchronizing mechanism. A
   higher frequency of risky dispersal movements in slowly growing
   populations appeared to accelerate predation rate. Thus, dispersal may
   induce a feedback-loop between predation and population growth that
   enhances synchrony.},

Abstract = {The use of domestic animals to protect livestock was reviewed through
   visits to actual users, discussions with experts and a thorough
   literature search. Costs and benefits were analysed in terms of reduced
   livestock losses. The most common guardian animals are dogs, which have
   been shown to reduce predation (documented mostly for coyote) by
   11-100\%. Livestock guardian dogs have also been used effectively
   against bear, wolf and cheetah. Donkeys are also used as guardian
   animals, and their effectiveness lies in their natural herding behaviour
   and aggression, especially against canids. The effectiveness of donkeys
   varies considerably dependent upon the predator species and the
   temperament of the individual donkey. Llamas are also used as a guardian
   animal, with approximately the same characteristics as the donkeys, and
   will defend themselves against most predators. The use of guardian
   animals appears to be an effective tool for reducing livestock
   depredation and should be evaluated in areas with high predation losses
   against the cost of changing production systems.},

Abstract = {The use of aversive conditioning, repellents and deterrents in the
   management of predator-livestock problems is evaluated based on a
   comprehensive literature review, contact with leading authorities and
   visits to areas with similar predation problems. The status of these
   management tools is reported and their applicability under Scandinavian
   conditions evaluated. Aversive conditioning usually involves treating
   baits with an emetic compound (usually lithium chloride), and has shown
   inconsistent and inconclusive results. Repellents and deterrents include
   physical, chemical and acoustic stimuli or devices that cause predators
   to stop an unwanted behaviour or to retreat from an area. Chemical
   repellents are not particularly effective against coyotes but have been
   effective for wolverines and bears under some conditions (e.g. with the
   availability of untreated, alternative prey). Projectile repellents give
   an immediate, positive result with bears, but their use is limited.
   Visual and acoustic devices work well, but only for a limited time, as
   predators quickly habituate to these devices. To summarize, these
   methods generally show little promise in reducing livestock depredation
   on a large-scale or long-term basis, especially under the conditions
   prevailing in Scandinavia.},

   artificially infected with salmon lice {[}Lepeophtheirus salmonis

   such as osmotic stress (increased chloride levels), first occurred after

   lice infections died throughout the experiment. Seven years of field
   investigation of Trondheimsfjorden showed that Atlantic salmon
   post-smolts descending coastal waters can become heavily infected with
   salmon lice. The migrating post-smolts were only infected with the
   chalimus stages, showing that the fish had only recently left the
   rivers. The infection level, however, varied considerably between the
   years, and, in 1998, the infection was higher than previous years. The
   experimental results have been combined with the field data to appraise
   the consequences of the infection.},

Title = {Relationships between sex ratio, climate and density in red deer: the
   importance of spatial scale},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {69},
Number = {6},
Pages = {959-974},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. Recently, contrasting evidence of density-dependent offspring sex
   ratio variation in red deer (Cervus elaphus L,) has been presented.
   Kruuk ct al. (1999) reported that the proportion of male red deer born
   on the island of Rum, Scotland, each year declined with increasing
   population density and with winter rainfall, i.e. as nutritional stress
   in females increased. In contrast, Post et al. (1999a) reported
   increasing male-biased offspring sex ratios in Hordaland, Norway, with
   both rising numbers of hinds and increasing values of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO), which they regarded an index of severe winters.
   2. Compared to Post ct al. (1999a), we reanalysed sex ratio variation on
   a greatly extended data set, including four populations of Norwegian red
   deer, taking into account a finer population substructure.
   3. The proportion of male calves shot each autumn declined markedly as
   density increased in all four populations. The proportion of male calves
   shot each autumn increased significantly with an increasing NAO index in
   one of the four populations, but there was no residual effect of the NAO
   once the effect of snow depth (at low elevation) was controlled for
   (decreasingly male biased harvest with increasing snow depth).
   4. At the west coast of Norway, the NAO is positively correlated with
   temperature and precipitation. However, since temperatures in this
   region often are around 0 degreesC during winter, the relationship
   between the NAO and snow depth may be difficult to predict,
   5. All analysis of variation in snow depth revealed that snow depth was
   negatively correlated with the NAO at low altitudes (below 400 m), but
   this relationship was reversed at high altitudes giving a positive
   correlation between snow depth and the NAG. We therefore suggest that a
   high NAO index indicates favourable winter conditions for red deer, as
   red deer winter at low altitude, and since recent studies show that a
   high index of the NAO is generally positively correlated with body
   weight in red deer. 6. Female red deer thus reared fewer sons as
   nutritional stress increased with increasing density and severity of
   climate in Norway, which is consistent with the birth sex ratios
   observed on Rum, Scotland.},

Title = {Latitudinal variation in growth of young brown trout Salmo trutta},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {1. A new laboratory-based growth model for brown trout (Salmo trutta)
   was used to explore latitudinal variation in growth among natural
   populations. The model included the effects of differences in ambient
   temperatures and fish size among populations. Annual growth rates of
   anadromous brown trout parr from 22. Norwegian populations at 61-70
   degreesN were compared with predictions from the growth model. Published
   field data from one Spanish, 15 British and four Danish populations at
   44-58 degreesN were included in the analysis to increase the latitudinal
   range.
   2. Among the Norwegian populations, the ratio between observed and
   predicted growth rates was not significantly different from 1.00 in
   eight rivers, but was significantly higher in eight, and was
   significantly lower in six. Observed growth was highest, relative to
   predicted growth, in the coldest rivers. In Spanish, British and Danish
   rivers, observed growth did not exceed predicted growth.
   3. The ratio between observed and predicted annual growth rate decreased
   significantly with increasing annual mean temperature. Observed annual
   growth was higher than predicted growth only in rivers with an annual
   mean temperature lower than 5.1 degreesC, and this indicates that some
   kind of thermal adaptation may occur in trout populations in the coldest
   rivers.
   4. Regression analyses showed that besides the direct effects of
   temperature and body size predicted by the growth model, annual growth
   rates were significantly related to annual mean temperature, densities
   of juvenile salmonids, duration of twilight (average for May-August) and
   latitude. Adding these variables to the original model increased the
   explanatory power from 73.9 to 80.6\%.},

Abstract = {Sea-run post-smelt Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (15-26 cm) from
   Storvatn, northern Norway (70 degrees 39'48{''}N) had significantly
   higher average specific growth rates in two years (1.64 and 1.66) than
   the corresponding lake-dwelling charr (0.53 and 1.20). The post-smelts
   displayed fast compensatory growth in the first 2-3 weeks of their sea
   residency, but then almost stopped growing prior to their return to
   fresh water. Lake-dwelling charr grew more evenly during the same time
   period. Thus, the anadromous charr may return to the lake after only 5-6
   weeks in the sea, because the potential to maintain a high growth rate
   in the sea is reduced. The marine diet consisted mainly of the two
   crustacean plankton species Calanus finmarchicus and Thysanoessa sp.
   (88\%), and less of fish (6\%), insects (4\%) and benthos (2\%). The
   diet of lake-dwelling charr consisted mainly of insects (58\%, mostly
   chironomid pupae) and zoobenthos (29\%), and less of zooplankton (13\%)
   during the same time period. Although post-smelts had the highest growth
   rates, they had significantly lower food consumption rates and higher
   frequencies of empty stomachs than the corresponding lake-dwelling fish.
   Possible explanations for this paradox are discussed in relation to
   stomach evacuation rates, water temperature, feeding behaviour and the
   energy content of the food in the two environments. (C) 2000 The

Abstract = {We used radio-collared individuals to examine the seasonal, annual, and
   regional variation in age-specific survival of moose (Alces alces) in
   three populations (Vega, Beiarn, and Troms) in northern Norway. In the
   two populations subject to a regular hunt, the annual mortality from
   hunting was higher, on average, than that from natural mortality for
   adult cows. In these study areas, the hunting mortality rate was higher
   for calves than for cows. For both age groups there was significant
   annual variation in hunting mortality, which was associated with
   differences in quota size among years. The survival rate of adult cows
   was high outside the hunting season (96\%). There was seasonal variation
   in survival among calves, the highest significant mortality being found
   among neonates during summer in Vega and Troms and significantly higher
   mortality being found during winter in Beiarn. The natural mortality of
   calves differed significantly among regions during both summer and
   winter. The combined effects of density dependence, changes in age
   structure, and environmental stochasticity may explain this variation in
   calf-survival rate. In contrast, no significant seasonal or regional
   variation occurred in the survival rate of adult females.},

Abstract = {Large herbivores generally depend on and interact with a food resource
   that is heterogeneous at different spatial scales. Plants allocate
   resources to rapid growth or to defence mechanisms depending on the
   availability of resources relative to loss of resources from herbivory.
   Herbivores select food and feeding habitats in order to maximize intake
   rate of nutrients and digestible energy, while avoiding chemical and
   structural deterrents. To optimize foraging, herbivores select habitats
   and food items in a hierarchical way, and different attracting and
   deterring factors may govern selection at different scales. We studied
   the impact of twig biting by a guild of indigenous browsers in three
   vegetation types in a semi-arid savanna in Botswana. The heaviest
   browsing pressure was in the vegetation type richest in preferred plant
   species, although that type was also richest in defended species. There
   were large differences in relative utilization between plant species,
   and ranking of species was roughly similar in the different vegetation
   types. Browsing pressure varied between species from almost 0-30\%.
   Overall, spinescent trees were less browsed than non-spinescent ones,
   and evergreen species were less browsed than deciduous ones. In two of
   the three vegetation types there was a negative correlation between
   browsing pressure on a species and its frequency. there was a high
   incidence of rebrowsing, and once a tree had been browsed, the
   probability that it would be browsed again increased. The results
   largely agree with predictions based on the resource availability
   hypothesis, the scarcity accessibility hypothesis and recent theories on
   the significance of plant defences and on plant's response to browsing
   and the subsequent response by herbivores on the plant's responses.},

Abstract = {Farm Atlantic salmon escape and invade rivers throughout the North
   Atlantic annually which has generated growing concern about their.
   impacts on native salmon populations. A large-scale experiment was
   therefore undertaken in order to quantify the lifetime success and
   interactions of farm salmon invading a Norwegian river. Sexually mature
   farm and native salmon were genetically screened, radio tagged and
   released into the River Imsa where no other. salmon had been allowed to
   ascend. The farm fishes were competitively and reproductively inferior,
   achieving less than one-third the breeding success of the native fishes.
   Moreover, this inferiority was scs biased, being more pronounced in farm
   males than females, resulting in tho principal route of gene flow
   involving native males mating with Farm females. There were also
   indications of selection against farm genotypes during early survival
   but not thereafter. However, evidence of resource competition and
   competitive displacement existed as the productivity of the native
   population was depressed by more than 30\%. Ultimately the lifetime
   reproductive success (adult to adult of the farm fishes was 16\% that of
   the native salmon. Our results indicate that such annual invasions have
   the potential for impacting on population productivity, disrupting local
   adaptations and reducing the genetic diversity of wild salmon
   populations.},

Abstract = {Photosynthetic efficiency was estimated by chlorophyll fluorescence

   Photosynthetic efficiency was positively correlated with environmental
   variables including annual temperature and a maritime gradient and was
   negatively correlated with the airborne concentrations of Cu, Ni, and
   SO2 from the Cu-Ni smelters. Photosynthetic efficiency in six plant
   species from the mixed forest, but not pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and
   three species from the birch forest was inversely correlated with SO2
   and the concentrations of Ni and Cu in lichens. Measurement of
   fluorescence in these species was a sensitive indicator of pollutant
   impact. Plant cover at the 16 study sites and the photosynthetic
   efficiency of five target species correlated with normalized difference

Abstract = {Estimates of the global number of arthropod species range from 2 million
   to more than 30 million species. One of the most critical assumptions
   affecting the higher of these estimates is the assumed magnitude of host
   specificity of phytophagous insects, which varies considerably.
   Difficulties in estimating this value are caused by both lack of
   satisfactory data sets and lack of methods for its objective
   calculation. We provide a new method for predicting host specificity for
   phytophagous insects at a local scale based on the concept of effective
   specialization. When the insect-plant host associations of a restricted
   number of plant species are known, we can predict the magnitude of host
   specificity when more plant species are included. Based on 2561 host
   observations of 697 beetle species on 50 plant species in the canopies
   of a tropical dry forest in Panama, we predict that host specificity for
   adult phytophagous beetles in this forest range from 7\% to 10\%. These
   values suggest that the higher estimates of global species richness are
   not tenable.},

Abstract = {The migratory behaviour of sea-ranched Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L.,
   was analysed by radio-telemetry in the River Gudenaa, Denmark. The main
   objectives were to: (1) estimate mortality of returning adults through
   the fjord; (2) observe rate of progression and migratory pattern in the
   fjord and river; and (3) record whether spawning occurs in the river.
   Forty-two returning salmon (19 males and 23 females of total body length
   from 60-97 cm) reared and released as smolts, were caught and equipped
   with external radio transmitters in the outer estuary of the River
   Gudenaa in 1994 and 1995. Of the tagged salmon, 18 (43\%) were caught in
   the estuary, four (10\%) were not recorded after release and 20 (47\%)
   entered the river. The mean rate of progression through the fjord was
   7.6 km d(-1) (range 1.4-18.2) in 1994 and 5.4 km d(-1) (range 1.6-17.1)
   in 1995. Eleven salmon were alive at the onset of the spawning period.
   Eight were retrieved dead from the river during or after the spawning
   period; four with empty gonads assumed to be successful spawners, and
   four with intact gonads. In 1994, unsuccessful spawners (found dead with
   intact gonads) entered the river earlier and had a longer total
   migration distance in the river compared to successful. spawners. This
   suggests that spawning success of sea-ranched salmon is associated with
   time of river entry and river migration length.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the migrations and geographic distribution of post-smolts
   of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in oceanic waters is sparse. Surface
   trawl surveys were carried out by the Institute of Marine Research,
   Bergen, Norway, in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent areas in 1990-1998.
   Sampling was carired out south of 62 degreesN in May-June, in the
   Norwegian Sea north of 62 degreesN in July-August and in the Barents Sea
   in August-September. In a total of 955 surface trawl hauls, 535
   post-smolts were caught. The highest incidences of post-smolts were in
   the slope current west of the British Isles, where the highest catch per
   unit of effort (c.p.u.e.) value was recorded between northern Scotland
   and the Faroes in June 1997. The lowest c.p.u.e. was observed in
   August/September 1998 in the Barents Sea, where no post-smolts were
   caught. The post-smolts appear to follow the main surface currents
   northwards into the Norwegian Sea where they spread in a fan-like
   distribution over an area covering most of the international waters
   between the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Norway, the Faroes and
   Iceland up to about 73-75 degreesN. This pattern appeared to be stable
   between these years with the exception of 1997, when almost no
   post-smolts were caught in the northernmost areas, although catches in
   the south were similar to or higher than in the previous years. The
   geographical distribution of post-smolts of Atlantic salmon is
   associated with the warmer, saline Atlantic water. (C) 2000

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {124},
Number = {3},
Pages = {381-390},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The population density and demography of five species of arctic
   Collembola were studied in a naturally patchy habitat, consisting of
   Carex ursinae tussocks with varying degrees of isolation. Focal
   predictor variables were those describing the spatial configuration of
   tussocks, including tussock size and isolation and the amount of habitat
   (cover) at a 1-m(2) scale surrounding each tussock population. The
   Collembola populations were heavily influenced by environmental
   stochasticity in the form of winter mortality and summer drought, and
   the influence of patchiness on population characteristics was evaluated
   in this context. The five species showed very different responses to the
   structuring effect of the habitat. depending on life history
   characteristics, mobility and habitat requirements. Population density
   was highly variable in both time and space. Spring densities indicated
   larger winter mortality compared to observations from a previous study,
   and the snow- and ice-free season from June to August only resulted in
   population growth for Folsomia sexoculata. In the other species, adult
   mortality must have been high as there was no net population growth
   despite observed reproduction. The exception was Hypogastrura viatica,
   whose population decline was more likely to have been the result of
   migration out of the study area. Cover was the most important variable
   explaining density. No pure area or isolation effects at the tussock
   level were detected, even in areas with very low habitat cover. Drought
   was probably an important mortality factor, as July was particularly
   warm and dry. Due to qualitative differences in the tussocks and the
   matrix substrate, desiccation risk would be higher during dispersal
   between tussocks. We suggest that increased dispersal mortality gave the
   observed pattern of increased density in relation to cover, both in
   general and in F. quadrioculata, an opportunistic species otherwise
   known for rapid population growth. Onychiurus green landicus, which had
   a similar density response to cover, may also be influenced by a rescue
   effect sustaining densities in areas with high cover. The cover effect
   can be viewed as a large-scale factor which encompasses the general
   spatial neighbourhood of each tussock, where inter-population processes
   are important, as opposed to internal patch dynamics.},

Title = {Conservation of biodiversity in Scandinavian boreal forests: large
   carnivores as flagships, umbrellas, indicators, or keystones?},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Pages = {857-868},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Large carnivores are often used as focal species (indicators, umbrellas,
   flagships or keystones) in conservation strategies either aimed at
   conserving carnivores, the rest of the biodiversity that occupies their
   habitats, or both. We evaluate their suitability for these roles in the
   context of boreal forest biodiversity conservation in the muti-use
   landscapes of Scandinavia. The enormous conflicts, especially with
   livestock, that carnivores cause in these areas makes them very
   controversial flagships to the extent that it may affect rural people's
   attitudes to conservation in general. Because of the broad habitat
   tolerance of large carnivores and their prey, and the difficulties in
   surveying carnivore numbers, they are very insensitive and impractical
   indicators of forest biodiversity. This ability of large carnivores to
   thrive in industrial forests means that the many species that are
   sensitive to modern forestry will not fall under the umbrella of areas
   managed for large carnivores. If large carnivores have a keystone
   function with respect to affecting the density of their ungulate prey it
   is likely to lead to even further conflicts with hunters who gain
   economic benefit from harvesting wild ungulates. In other words, none of
   the classic `ecological' arguments are likely to help justify large
   carnivore conservation, and large carnivore conservation is unlikely to
   help conserve the rest of the boreal forest's biodiversity. Based on
   these arguments we recommend that (1) justification for large carnivore
   conservation focus on the real philosophical and value orientated
   reasons rather than ecological justifications, (2) that this
   conservation should be brought about in practice by dedicated management
   programs that specifically address the conflicts caused by large
   carnivores, and (3) that boreal forest biodiversity is best conserved by
   specific actions designed to establish reserves or change forestry
   practices.},

Title = {Factors affecting maternal care in an income breeder, the European roe
   deer},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {672-682},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Maternal care is a major component of demographic tactics in mammals.
   In ungulates most work has been done on capital breeders (e.g. bighorn
   sheep), which rely heavily on body reserves to raise their young. Roe
   deer, in contrast, are close to the income breeder end of the
   capital-income breeder continuum, and show high levels of maternal care.
   2. The aim of this study was to explore the factors determining the
   level of maternal care in roe deer, in particular the effects of
   maternal body weight, mother's parity, litter size and year of birth on
   the amount of prenatal care (i.e. the average mass of an offspring
   multiplied by the number of offspring) and postnatal care (i.e. the
   average growth rate of the offspring multiplied by their number). The
   study was carried out on a captive population of roe deer fed ad
   libitum, and in a wild population.
   3. In both populations prenatal care increased with increasing maternal
   body weight. In the population fed ad libitum this effect was found in
   light females only (< 22 kg); in the wild population the positive
   relationship between maternal body weight and prenatal care was entirely
   accounted for by variation in litter size (i.e. heaviest females
   produced larger litters) and density (i.e. females were lightest in
   years with high population density). Parity did not affect prenatal
   care.
   4. In 14 females fed ad libitum there was no relationship between
   postnatal care and maternal body weight. Multiparous females had higher
   levels of postnatal care. In contrast, 20 wild females showed a positive
   relationship between postnatal care and maternal body weight, and only
   litter size affected the level of postnatal care.
   5. Even after accounting for the confounding effects of maternal body
   weight, parity, litter size and population density, we found no
   trade-off between pre- and postnatal care in any of the two populations.
   The conditions under which the pattern of maternal care could impose
   trade-offs that affect the individual offspring are discussed.},

   parr were larger in length and weight at age than fluvial parr.
   Back-calculated lengths indicated that lacustrine salmon parr were
   recruited from the fastest growing part of the populations and they had
   larger growth (length) increments between age intervals than fluvial
   parr. There was no consistent pattern in growth comparisons between parr

Abstract = {We examined the irruptive potential of a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
   population on a 10-km(2) island 2 km off the coast of central Norway (63
   degrees 40' N). As roe deer density increased from 10 to 34.5
   animals/km(2) from spring 1991 to spring 1994, reproductive status was
   determined in 33 2-year old and 66 adult, radiocollared does. Body mass
   was known for 19 adults and 12 2-year old females. The studied
   population had a high overall rate of increase, r = 0.409, although this
   decreased with increasing population density. Density only explained
   2.8\% and 6.7\% of the variation in maternal body mass of 2-year olds
   and adults, respectively, and an examination of individual trajectories
   showed that density did not affect litter size either. Body mass did not
   affect reproductive status in the 2 age groups; however, body mass
   affected the number of fawns produced. Females with above average body
   mass had 40\% higher productivity than females with below average body
   mass. The ability of female roe deer to maintain high body condition and
   high reproductive rates at high density means that monitoring of vital
   rates alone will not allow managers to detect these potential rapid
   increases in density until they have irrupted. Therefore, direct
   monitoring of population size or an index of population abundance is
   needed to allow rapid changes in harvest level that can prevent
   irruptions.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that intestinal helminth communities in freshwater brown
   trout are dissimilar in composition and structure to those in the
   European eel was tested by an analysis of component communities from 72
   localities and of infracommunities from 34 localities in the British
   Isles and Norway. Derived indices were then compared with published data
   from eels. Composition of helminth communities differed considerably
   between the two hosts as a group of 4 species occurred commonly in trout
   and so gave greater predictability to the community composition. These 4
   species were trout specialists and in 97 \% of the localities a trout
   specialist dominated the community rather than a generalist
   acanthocephalan as is typical for eels. By contrast all measures of
   community structure and indices of richness and diversity indicated that
   helminth communities in trout were isolationist in character, species
   poor and exhibited low diversity at both component and infracommunity
   levels. All values of indices for trout helminth communities were
   strikingly similar to those obtained from eels. Evidence of
   interspecific interactions within the trout helminth communities and a
   limit of 4 to infracommunity species richness further enhanced the
   similarities and suggested a common determinant of community structure.
   The hypothesis was thus supported in respect of species composition but
   refuted in respect of community structure.},

Abstract = {Tissue from the wing tips of the endangered Apollo butterfly (Parnassius
   apollo L.) were collected at the end of a breeding season from two sites
   in Norway: Bandak and Gjendetunga/Bukkelaegret about 250 km apart. We
   investigated the suitability of such non-lethal samples as a source of
   DNA for studying these populations. Universal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   primers were used to amplify DNA from the wing tip extractions. Primers
   spanning the 12s rRNA region produced 0.35 kb fragments that proved to
   be invariable in the selected samples when tested for restriction length
   polymorphisms (RFLPs). These sequences had high homology with analogous
   mtDNA from other insect sources, e.g. lepidoptera {[}Spodoptera litura
   (Fabricius)], and served to authenticate the DNA. Random amplified
   polymorphic DNA (RAPDs) technology was then used to screen for genetic
   variability. Of several primers tested, Primer-01 (Operon Kit F)
   produced a profile that differentiated the population with 88\% (P <
   0.001) efficiency based on multivariate logistic regression analysis of
   banding profiles. RAPDs were also adapted to develop different molecular
   marker approaches to screen the samples quickly and cheaply. This work
   indicates that reliable `molecular tags' can be designed to track
   demographic populations to study their distribution without endangering
   the butterfly and highlights the suitability of these markers for use in
   future population studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Foraging of Eurasian lynxes Lynx lynx was studied with telemetry and
   snow tracking in central Norway. In all habitats and at all seasons,
   medium-sized ungulates (roe deer Capreolus capreolus, reindeer Rangifer
   tarandus and domestic sheep Ovis aries) dominated the diet (81\% of
   ingested biomass estimated from faeces). Mountain hares Lepus timidus
   and galliform birds comprised the remainder of the diet (15\% and 3\%,
   respectively). Lynxes with different life history status did not differ
   in prey choice, but adult males utilised carcasses of ungulate prey
   considerably less (16\% of the edible parts) than did females with
   offspring (80\%) and subadults (58\%). Forest habitats in lowlands and
   adjacent to cultivated fields were the most favourable foraging habitats
   (indexed as the prey encounter rate per km lynx track) primarily owing
   to the presence of roe deer. Two family groups tracked in winter killed
   0.2 ungulate per day. The importance of agricultural land as a foraging
   habitat and the dominance of livestock in the diet in remoter areas
   indicate that the lynx has responded to agriculture and reindeer
   husbandry during the past century by switching from small game to
   ungulates.},

Abstract = {We investigated the blood concentrations of organochlorines (OCs) and
   the diet of glaucous gulls Larus hyperboreus breeding in two
   neighbouring areas at Bear Island in the Barents Sea, north-eastern
   Atlantic. One area was situated on the edge of the large seabird cliff,
   about 100-150 m above sea level. The second area was about 1-2 km from
   the seabird cliff, and 10-50 m above sea level. In both 1997 and 1998
   there were significant differences between the breeding areas for five
   OCs (HCB, HCH, Oxychlordan, DDE and PCB) measured, with the birds
   breeding on the cliff having higher levels. These differences were
   accompanied by a difference in diet between the areas. Birds in the
   former area had at least four times higher intake of guillemot Uria spp.
   eggs, while the birds near sea level seemed to have a much higher intake
   of fish. This study demonstrates the importance of feeding ecology for
   the distribution of OCs within populations. The results have important
   implications for the establishment of monitoring programs for OC
   contamination of the glaucous gull in the Arctic.},

Abstract = {The substantial growth of the farmed salmon industry in Europe since the
   1970s has highlighted concerns regarding the genetic impact of escaped
   farmed salmon on wild salmonid stocks. High incidences of salmon x trout
   hybrids have been recorded in rivers situated near intensive salmon
   farming in Norway and Scotland, which may be indicative of a breakdown
   in reproductive isolation between salmon, Salmo salar L., and brown
   trout, Salmo trutta L, In the present study, salmonid fry and 0+ parr
   were collected from rivers in western Ireland. Allozyme and
   minisatellite DNA analysis were carried out on fry to determine the
   frequency of F1 hybrids from 10 rivers located within 38 km of salmon
   farms and three rivers at least 80 km from salmon farms. A total of 49
   hybrids were recorded from 4135 salmonid fry (frequency = 1.2\%).
   Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that all hybrids arose from Atlantic
   salmon female x brown trout male crosses. Hybrid parr were recorded from
   one of the low-risk rivers (1.0\%), but were present in seven out of the
   10 catchments located within 38 km of salmon farms, with frequencies
   ranging from 0.7\% to 3.1\%. The results of the present survey, which
   represents the first extensive record of the levels of salmon-trout
   hybridization in Ireland, are discussed in relation to the continued
   growth of salmon farming in this country.},

Abstract = {Time and mode of herbivory on savanna trees and their subsequent
   responses are dependent on, among other things, earlier herbivory and
   fire. We used clipping (simulated browsing) and stem cutting (simulated
   heavy browsing and to some extent simulated fire) to evaluate such
   interactions. Study organisms were a deciduous, broad-leaved tree
   species, Combretum apiculatum (Combretaceae), browsing large herbivores
   and leaf-eating insects. The treatments were done in the late dry season
   before bud break. Late in the following wet season, we recorded plant
   responses to treatment and browsing. The treated trees, especially the
   cut ones, responded by producing larger and fewer annual shoots.
   Compared to control trees, there was a slight increase in shoot biomass
   of clipped trees and a strong reduction of cut ones. Leaf area increased
   in clipped trees, but decreased in cut ones. A marked increase in the
   number of browsed trees was recorded amongst treated trees. Number of
   bites, consumption and utilization also increased with severity of
   treatment. In contrast, insect herbivory was reduced on both clipped and
   cut trees. The observed patterns are discussed in relation to current
   ideas on plant - herbivore interactions.},

Pages = {565-567},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Why do highly fecund organisms apparently sacrifice offspring size for
   increased numbers when offspring survival generally increases with
   size(1-3)? The theoretical tools for understanding this evolutionary
   trade-off between number and size of offspring have developed over the
   past 25 years(1,4-10); however, the absence of data on the relation
   between offspring size and fitness in highly fecund species, which would
   control for potentially confounding variables, has caused such models to
   remain largely hypothetical(11,12). Here we manipulate egg size,
   controlling for maternal trait interactions, and determine the causal
   consequences of offspring size in a wild population of Atlantic salmon.
   The joint effect of egg size on egg number and offspring survival
   resulted in stabilizing phenotypic selection for an optimal size. The
   optimal egg size differed only marginally from the mean value observed
   in the population, suggesting that it had evolved mainly in response to
   selection on maternal rather than offspring fitness. We conclude that
   maximization of maternal fitness by sacrificing offspring survival may
   well be a general phenomenon among highly fecund organisms.},

Abstract = {To assess how important reindeer Rangifer tarandus fences are as a
   mortality factor for ptarmigan Lagopus spp. we collected data during
   1991-1994. Our fieldwork covered 12 different sections of reindeer fence
   (totalling 71.1 km) in the county of Finnmark, northern Norway. The
   sections consisted of steel wire, steel netting or a combination of
   these, and ranged in height from 100 to 250 cm. The fieldwork took the
   form of spring patrols during which dead birds and their remains were
   searched for along the fences immediately after snow melt. We covered a
   total of 179.9 km and found 253 collision victims belonging to at least
   20 species. Of the 253 victims found, 215 were willow ptarmigan Lagopus
   lagopus and rock ptarmigan L. mutus; thus these two species comprised
   85\% of the victims. During the winters of 1992/93 and 1993/94, we
   carried out experiments with dummy willow ptarmigan which were placed
   along fence sections and monitored serving as artificial fence-strike
   victims. Our experiments showed that approximately 64\% of the total
   number of ptarmigan killed by the fences during winter would be detected
   during spring patrols along the fences. The type and height of the fence
   had no effect on the ptarmigan collision rate. In contrast, both the
   fence section and year factor contributed significantly to the observed
   variation in collision rate. We estimate that on average 1.4 +/- 0.5
   (SE) ptarmigan are being killed per kilometre of reindeer fence in
   Finnmark annually, with a greater variation between fence sections than
   between years.},

Title = {How vulnerable are denning bears to disturbance?},
Journal = {WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {400-413},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {When exposed to human disturbance, most large carnivores are able to
   move away from the source with little energetic cost. Bears represent an
   exception in that during winter, most individuals spend several months
   in an energy-saving state of hibernation in a den. This implies that
   disturbance of denning bears has the potential to have a large energetic
   cost, although data on the subject are rather diffuse. We reviewed the
   literature on densite selection, denning physiology, and responses to
   disturbance for the brown bear (Ursus arctos), black bear (U.
   americanus), and polar bear (U. maritimus). Generally, bears select dens
   one to 2 km from human activity (roads, habitation, industrial activity)
   and seemed to tolerate most activities that occurred more than one km
   from the den. Activity closer than one km and especially within 200 m
   caused variable responses. Some bears tolerate disturbance even inside
   the den, but bears will abandon dens in response to activity within this
   zone, especially early in the denning period. Den abandonment by brown
   and black bear females with cubs of the year can lead to increased cub
   mortality. Specific excavated or ground dens are rarely reused, whereas
   natural caves or hollow trees are reused with varying frequency. There

Abstract = {In the early 1960s, 156 arable fields scattered across Oxfordshire and
   Berkshire were surveyed. A full resurvey of all these fields which were
   still in arable production was carried out in 1997. The results were
   used to assess the change in status of arable weed species over the past
   30 years. Many of the rarer species found in the original survey were
   found over 30 years later at the same sites, suggesting that the
   distribution of scarce species may not have contracted as seriously as
   had been believed. However, although these species persist in the seed
   bank, their overall abundance has declined markedly and consequently
   urgent, active conservation measures should be undertaken to prevent
   further extinctions within this species group. Requirements for
   conservation of rare arable plants are considered. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {Timing of breeding and offspring size are maternal traits that may
   influence offspring competitive ability, dispersal, foraging, and
   vulnerability to predation and climatic conditions. To quantify the
   extent to which these maternal traits may ultimately affect an
   organism's fitness, we undertook laboratory and field experiments with
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). To control for confounding effects caused
   by correlated traits, manipulations of the timing of fertilization
   combined with intraclutch comparisons were used. In the wild, a total of
   1462 juveniles were marked at emergence from gravel nests. Recapture
   rates suggest that up to 83.5\% mortality occurred during the first four
   months after emergence from the gravel nests, with the majority (67.5\%)
   occurring during the initial period ending 17 days after median
   emergence. Moreover, the mortality was selective during this initial
   period, resulting in a significant phenotypic shift toward an earlier
   date of and an increased length at emergence. However, no significant
   selection differentials were detected thereafter, indicating that the
   critical episode of selection had occurred at emergence. Furthermore,
   standardized selection gradients indicated that selection was more
   intense on date of than on body size at emergence. Timing of emergence
   had additional consequences in terms of juvenile body size.
   Late-emerging juveniles were smaller than early-emerging ones at
   subsequent samplings, both in the wild and in parallel experiments
   conducted in seminatural stream channels, and this may affect success at
   subsequent size-selective episodes, such as winter mortality and
   reproduction. Finally, our findings also suggest that egg size had
   fitness consequences independent of the effects of emergence time that
   directly affected body size at emergence and, in turn, survival and size
   at later life stages. The causality of the maternal effects observed in
   the present study supports the hypothesis that selection on juvenile
   traits may play an important role in the evolution of maternal traits in
   natural populations.},

Abstract = {We examined two long-term tagging studies with wild salmon stocks in the
   North Sea area. The salmon stocks, the Figgjo in southern Norway and the
   North Esk in eastern Scotland, reside in relatively un-impacted rivers
   that continue to sustain healthy runs of salmon. The return rates for
   one seawinter fish (ISW), the predominant age at maturity for both
   stocks, were highly correlated. An analysis of sea surface temperature
   distributions for periods of high versus low return rate showed that
   when low sea surface temperatures dominate the North Sea and southern
   coast of Norway during May, salmon survival has been poor. Conversely,
   when high sea surface temperatures extend northward along the Norwegian
   coast during May, survival has been good. Ocean conditions can be
   further related to the recruitment process through growth studies for
   the North Esk stock. Post-smelt growth increments for returning ISW fish
   showed that enhanced growth was associated with years during which
   temperature conditions were favorable, which in turn resulted in higher
   survival rates. The implicit linkage between growth and survival
   suggests that growth-mediated predation is the dominant source of
   recruitment variability. Mechanisms by which ocean climate may affect
   post-smelt growth are discussed. (C) 2000 international Council for the

Abstract = {The distribution of woody vegetation was studied in forest edges and
   hedgerows in a 28 km(2) southern Swedish agricultural area,
   characterised by species-rich edge zones. The occurrence of 21 selected
   woody species (taxa) was related to differences in both edge structure
   and landscape structure. All the species studied were represented in
   both edge types, but a higher frequency of animal-dispersed species was
   found in hedgerows.
   Animal dispersed species were more affected by edge width and density
   than wind dispersed species. A higher number of wind-dispersed species
   were more frequent in forest edges, in hedgerows near to forest, or with
   a high proportion of forest within 500 m. A clear relationship was found
   between the number of physically connected elements in hedgerow networks
   and increasing frequency of occurrence for Corylus avellana, Crataegus
   spp., Euonymus europaeus, and Quercus robur; which indicate the
   ecological significance of connectedness for certain animal dispersed
   species. The study supports the general principle that woody species
   distribution and landscape structure are linked in a positive feedback
   loop. The results match findings from studies in other countries and are
   interpreted in the context of landscape processes and the ecological
   characteristics of woody plant species. We emphasise the importance of
   understanding dispersal mechanisms of woody species for the design and
   improvement of edge habitats in agricultural landscapes.},

Volume = {9},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the 1930s, the Scandinavian brown bear was close to extinction due to
   vigorous extermination programmes in Norway and Sweden. Increased
   protection of the brown bear in Scandinavia has resulted in the recovery
   of four subpopulations, which currently contain close to 1000
   individuals. Effective conservation and management of the Scandinavian
   brown bear requires knowledge of the current levels of genetic diversity
   and gene flow among the four subpopulations. Earlier studies of
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity revealed extremely low levels of
   genetic variation, and population structure that grouped the three
   northern subpopulations in one genetic clade and the southernmost
   subpopulation in a second highly divergent clade. In this study, we
   extended the analysis of genetic diversity and gene flow in the
   Scandinavian brown bear using data from 19 nuclear DNA microsatellite
   loci. Results from the nuclear loci were strikingly different than the
   mtDNA results. Genetic diversity levels in the four subpopulations were
   equivalent to diversity levels in nonbottlenecked populations from North
   America, and significantly higher than levels in other bottlenecked and
   isolated brown bear populations. Gene flow levels between subpopulations
   ranged from low to moderate and were correlated with geographical
   distance. The substantial difference in results obtained using mtDNA and
   nuclear DNA markers stresses the importance of collecting data from both
   types of genetic markers before interpreting data and making
   recommendations for the conservation and management of natural
   populations. Based on the results from the mtDNA and nuclear DNA data
   sets, we propose one evolutionarily significant unit and four management
   units for the brown bear in Scandinavia.},

Abstract = {Potential avoidance by wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) of
   high-altitude tourist resorts during winter was investigated in and near
   Rondane National Park in Norway. Distribution of reindeer was mapped
   using systematic snowmobile surveys during 1991-96 and compared with
   results from investigations of snow and vegetation characteristics.
   Maternal reindeer avoided a 10 km zone around the resort. Cows and
   calves increased in density from 0.6 +/- 0.6 reindeer km(-2) at 5-10 km
   from the resort to 7.6 +/- 2.2 reindeer km(-2) at 15-25 km from the
   resort. Bulls and yearlings were more tolerant, constituting nearly 92\%
   of all observed animals 5-10 km from the resort. Nearly all animals
   avoided the zone within 5 km of the resort. There were no significant
   differences in distribution of lichen heath, hardness of snow,
   integrated ram hardness index (IRH) values, or snow depths on ridges
   with increasing distance from the resort. Available biomass of lichens
   was ca. 1200 g m(-2) 0-5 km from the resort and decreased to a low of
   ca. 250 g m(-2) at 15-25 km distance, a pattern that probably reflects
   overgrazing as a result of avoiding the tourist resort. Such avoidance
   implies reduced forage intake during winter, substantial reduction in
   available habitat, and lower productivity of the herd. The results
   suggest that avoidance by wild animals of sources of anthropogenic
   disturbance may involve long-term impacts, such as reductions in
   carrying capacity, that are more serious than those expected from direct
   physiological stress.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that the spatial distribution of many marine
   pelagic organisms can be described by a hierarchical patch structure.
   Here, we present evidence for a hierarchical spatial distribution of
   murres (Uria spp.) foraging on capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the
   Barents Sea. We found three distinct levels of patchiness. At the
   largest level we found spatial structures with a characteristic scale of
   >300 km, and a spatial overlap between murre and capelin. Within the
   large-scale structures, we found medium-scale patches with a
   characteristic scale of similar to 50 km, and an overlap between the
   patches of murre and capelin. Within the medium-scale patches we found
   small-scale patches with a characteristic scale of similar to 3 km. At
   the smallest scale there was no overlap between patches of capelin and
   murre. Our results indicate that murres actively track the spatial
   distribution of capelin at several scales. We suggest that murres use a
   strategy where the search pattern reflects the hierarchical properties
   of the prey system. Under this hypothesis the predator searches for
   large-scale patches by using long travel distances and low turning
   frequency. Once within a large-scale patch, the predator starts
   searching for smaller scale patches by using shorter travel distances
   and higher turning frequencies. Such a search pattern will minimize the
   area to be searched by the predator and move the predator upward in the
   hierarchical prey system in a stepwise fashion.},

Abstract = {The Norwegian Monitoring Programme for Forest Damage has now been
   running since 1984. Its main objective has been monitoring the boreal
   forest conditions in relation to air pollution. Surveys of forests are
   performed on plots in a nation-wide representative grid network, in a
   network of local countywise plots, and in a network of intensively
   monitored plots within the framework of the internationally co-ordinated
   UN/ECE ICP Forests. At intensively monitored plots, a number of
   measurements were performed, for example tree crown-condition
   assessments, foliar chemistry, air pollution, precipitation chemistry
   (open area and stand throughfall), soil and soil-water chemistry.
   Vitality criteria have shown a declining trend, expressed as reduced
   crown density and more of discoloured trees, particularly in spruce
   forests. These results are similar to findings in other Scandinavian
   countries and coincide with the general trend in Europe. Forest yield
   has increased in later years in most parts of Norway. Tree mortality in
   excess of normal is not recorded.
   Considering these results, it is reasonable to presume that most
   Norwegian forest ecosystems are generally in a good condition. Areas in
   the south-eastern part of the country, however, may have shown
   indications of a slightly reduced crown condition. These areas are
   located in a region with a relatively high load of air pollution and low
   buffering capacity against acidification. Although forest conditions
   generally depend on soil, tree age, climate, pests and diseases, and
   other natural stressors; air pollution loads add to, or may interact
   with, these factors. Most likely inciting factors (e.g. summer drought)
   have occurred and produced visual symptoms. The actual effect of the air
   pollution component is, therefore, difficult to estimate; however, its
   importance is not discounted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {The relative importance of trees versus lianas as hosts for phytophagous
   beetles (Coleoptera) in tropical forests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aim Insect assemblages associated with lianas in tropical forests are
   poorly studied compared with those associated with trees. The importance
   of lianas for the maintenance of local species richness of insect
   herbivores in tropical forests is therefore poorly understood. With this
   in mind, a comparative study of the relative importance of trees and
   lianas as hosts for phytophagous beetles was carried out.
   Location The study area was located in the canopy of a dry tropical
   forest in Parque Natural Metropolitano, Panama province, Republic of
   Panama.
   Methods A crane system was utilized to access the canopy. The number of
   species and host specialization of adult phytophagous beetles associated
   with twenty-six liana species of ten different families, and twenty-four
   tree species of twelve different families were compared.
   Results A total of 2561 host associations of 697 species of beetles were
   determined (1339 for trees and 1222 for lianas). On average 55.8 +/- 6.8
   beetle species were found to be associated with each tree species while
   the comparable number for lianas was 47.0 +/- 6.1.
   The pooled numbers of phytophagous beetle species associated with trees
   and lianas, respectively, were not significantly different. However,
   there were significantly more species feeding on green plant parts on
   lianas than on trees, and there were significantly more wood eaters on
   trees than on lianas.
   Phytophagous beetles associated with lianas were significantly more
   specialized than the tree associates due to a higher degree of
   specialization among the species feeding on green plant parts of lianas.
   Wood eaters and flower visitors showed no differences in host
   specialization on different growth forms.
   Main conclusion The present study shows that lianas are at least as
   important as trees for the maintenance of local species diversity of
   phytophagous beetles at this site. The mechanisms that drive the
   patterns can only be hypothesized. Plant architecture, size, and length
   of growing season are probably involved. Further studies, should include
   measurements of plant traits to elucidate experimentally what mechanisms
   that drive the patterns. Additional insight would come from similar
   studies in other forest types, and also studies of other major taxonomic
   groups of arthropod herbivores.},

Journal = {PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {120},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The observation that the total abundance of adult nematodes in the
   abomasum of Svalbard reindeer increases between October and April
   suggests adaptation to cope with the Arctic winter. Here we investigate
   the extent to which selection has led to similar life-history strategies
   in the 3 most numerous trichostrongyle species. The life-histories are
   found to differ markedly. We use flexible statistical models for the
   abundance and dispersion of parasites in the host population. One of the
   taxa, Marshallagia marshalli, was most abundant and had its highest egg
   output in the winter. In contrast, the abundance of the most common
   taxa, Ostertagia gruehneri, m. gruehneri was stable or declined from
   autumn to late winter, and the closely related taxa, O. gruehneri, m.
   arcticus, showed a similar over winter drop. The faecal egg output of
   these 2 taxa was highest in summer, as found in temperate
   trichostrongyle species. Despite the apparent contamination of summer
   pastures with O. gruehneri, calves showed negligible burdens until their
   second summer and the abundance of infection reached an asymptote within
   their third year. In contrast, the abundance of M. marshalli in calves
   showed a rapid increase over the first summer and by late winter was
   similar to peak levels found in adults (8000 worms). This increase could
   not be accounted for by the developing abomasum larvae population and is
   therefore evidence for transmission over the winter for this taxa. While
   M. marshalli showed little between-year variation, O. gruehneri showed
   2-fold fluctuation in the abundance of infection. O. gruehneri may
   therefore play a role in the fluctuating population dynamics of the
   host. Since there was no apparent decline in abundance with host age in
   any of the 3 taxa there was no evidence of reindeer mounting an immune
   response.},

Abstract = {Movements of radio-tagged pike Esox lucius (L.), pikeperch Stizostedion
   lucioperca (L.) and outward migrating sea trout smolts Salmo trutta (L.)
   were studied in a shallow Danish reservoir to obtain information of
   predator-prey interactions between these species. Twenty pikeperch
   (55-74 cm) and 19 pike (52-72 cm) were tagged. Female pikeperch spent
   more time near the outlet sluice during the smolt run (May) than at
   other times of the year, apparently actively hunting the smolts delayed
   in this area. In contrast, male pikeperch did not seem to participate in
   the smolt predation but remained stationary during the smolt run,
   presumably guarding their nests. Most tagged pike were present at the
   spawning grounds during the peak of the smolt run, where they had little
   chance of smolt encounter. Twenty migrating trout smolts were
   radio-tagged in the river upstream of the reservoir. Ten of these were
   located in the vicinity of the outlet sluice at least once, but were
   unwilling or unable to find and enter the sub-surface outlet sluice.
   Only one tagged smolt left the reservoir. After 1-12 days in the
   reservoir, the remaining smolts were eaten by pikeperch or pike and the
   results indicate that female pikeperch and few female pike have adjusted
   their behaviour to predation on smolts during the smolt run. The smolt
   predation in this man-made reservoir is higher than in natural lakes,
   probably due to the changed physical environment and introduced
   predators, such as pikeperch. The outlet sluice practice and the
   temporal overlap between smolt run and predator-spawning may be key
   factors in smolt survival. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Age-specific harvest mortality in a Norwegian moose Alces alces
   population},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {41-52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The annual age- and sex-specific patterns of harvest mortality in a
   Norwegian moose Alces alces population during a period of 17 years for
   females and 24 years for males were estimated using cohort analysis. In
   males the harvest mortality increased with age, whereas in females the
   pattern was U-shaped with higher harvest mortality of less fecund young
   (1-3 year) and old (greater than or equal to 10 years) age classes, and
   lower harvest mortality of prime age (4-9 years old) females. In both
   sexes, the calf harvest mortality was low, although it increased with
   increasing calf quotas following a change from an indiscriminate to a
   sex- and age-specific hunting system during the study period. In adult
   males, the mortality pattern was opposite of what was expected based on
   the previously reported higher susceptibility to hunting of young than
   old males, indicating that hunter selectivity for large (old) males
   affected the pattern. Moreover, the selectivity of the hunters decreased
   as the hunting pressure increased, suggesting that the hunters became
   less selective when the mean time available per moose in the quota
   decreased. Among adult female age groups, the variation in harvest
   mortality increased with the proportion of calves per female in the
   population prior to hunting. This was mainly because of relatively
   higher mortality of post-prime females, supporting our expectation that
   hunters avoid shooting females with calves and thus increase the harvest
   of less fecund age groups during high recruitment years. The observed
   selectivity led to harvest mortality that differed significantly from
   patterns of natural mortality, even where the mortality is mainly due to
   wolves Canis lupus and bears Ursus arctos. This may have consequences
   for the life history evolution of both male and female moose. The
   potential ecological, evolutionary and management implications of the
   results are discussed.},

Abstract = {We examined the winter diet of Stellar's Elders (Polysticta stelleri) in
   Varangerfjord, northern Norway, by analyzing the esophagus content of 29
   individuals (12 juveniles and 17 adults). A total of 8389 prey items of
   31 species were identified: 13 species of gastropods (making up 68.4\%
   of total number of items); 4 species of bivalves (18.5\%); 12 species of
   crustaceans (13\%); and 2 species of echinoderms (<0.1\%). In terms of
   percentage aggregate wet weight 31.4\% was gastropods, 22.6\% was
   bivalves, and 41.4\% was crustaceans. Juvenile elders ate more
   crustaceans ((x) over bar = 61\% aggregate w.w.) than adults ((x) over
   bar = 26\%, P < 0.05), possibly because they were in poor body condition
   and may have had higher energy requirements than adults. Adults tended
   to eat more gastropods ((x) over bar = 41\% vs 22\%) and Mytilus edulis
   ((x) over bar = 27\% vs 12\%) than juveniles. There were only small
   differences between sexes. Most of the prey items were of species known
   to be associated with kelp plants, especially Laminaria hyperborea,
   suggesting that Steller's Elders obtain a large proportion of their prey
   directly from the vegetation.},

Volume = {59},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A previous experimental study of great snipe, Gallinago media, has
   reported an effect on male mating success of the amount of white in
   their tails. That result is one of a very limited set of existing
   experimental results supporting a female mate preference for a
   morphological trait in animals. However, a later observational study did
   not find any correlation between amount of white and male mating
   success. If females sample a limited number of males, their preferences
   need not result in strong relationships between mating success and trait
   values in males, possibly explaining the failure to find the predicted
   correlation. Yet, females of lekking species are thought to have ample
   opportunities for mate sampling. To resolve these contrasting results,
   we present in this paper (1) a larger correlational study (several leks
   during 10 years) showing no relationship between male mating success and
   whiteness of tails (measured in several ways), and most importantly (2)
   evidence that individual females do not mate predominantly with males
   with very white tails among those; males that each female samples. These
   results show that females do not prefer males with whiter tails as
   mates, within the contemporary natural variation in the trait. They also
   show that there is no sexual selection of the trait at present. This
   does not necessarily imply that white tails are not a sexually selected
   adaptation in males, but the mechanisms are likely to have been
   different from direct mate choice of whiter tails per se. (C) 2000 The

Title = {Sex and size related differences in the dry season feeding patterns of
   elephants in Chobe National Park, Botswana},

Abstract = {Differences in feeding patterns of the African elephant were examined by
   sex and age during the dry season in a dystrophic savanna-woodland
   ecosystem in northern Botswana. Adult males had the least diverse diet
   in terms of woody plant species, but they consumed more plant parts than
   family units. The diameter of stems of food plants broken or bitten off
   was also greater for adult males than for females and subadult males.
   Adult males spent more time foraging on each woody plant than did
   females. The number of woody plant species and individuals present were
   higher at feeding sites of family units than at feeding sites of adults
   males, indicating that family units positioned themselves at feeding
   sites with higher species diversity than those of males. We argue that
   the most likely explanation for these differences is related to the
   pronounced sexual size dimorphism exhibited by elephants, resulting in
   sex differences in browsing patterns due to the allometric relationships
   that govern the tolerance of herbivores for variation in diet quality.
   From our results this Body Size Hypothesis is accepted rather than the
   alternative Scramble Competition Hypothesis, which predicts that adult
   male elephants consume lower quality browse because they are displaced
   from preferred browse as an outcome of scramble competition with adult
   females and their offspring. If the feeding patterns of adult male
   elephants were affected by intersexual scramble competition, we would
   expect adult males to browse at a higher level in the canopy than the
   smaller-bodied females and their offspring. No evidence was found for
   this, although adult females were found to browse at a higher level in
   the canopy when feeding in close proximity to subadults and juveniles
   than when feeding alone. Sex differences in elephant browsing patterns
   are, we propose, of relevance to understanding and managing elephant
   impacts on African woodlands.},

Title = {Hunting effort and game vulnerability studies on a small scale: a new
   technique combining radio-telemetry, GPS and GIS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {182-190},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Global positioning systems (GPS) were used to track hunters in an
   area of central Norway where willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus were
   contemporaneously radio-tracked. A geographical information system (GIS)
   was then used to study spatiotemporal interactions between hunters and
   game.
   2. Recording hunting activity with the GPS produced accurate and
   unbiased information about the behaviour and effort of hunters. When GPS
   tracking nine hunters during 50 hunter-days, data were lost for an
   estimated time of 30 h 45 min, which constituted about 10\% of the total
   hunting time.
   3. Willow ptarmigan hunters walked on average 16.2 km daily at a speed
   of 2.8 km h(-1), and they hunted for 9 h each day, of which almost 6 h
   was active hunting time. During 50 hunter-days they had 295 h of active
   hunting, covered a distance of 818 km and harvested 20\% of the willow
   ptarmigan population in the area.
   4. The spatial distribution of hunting pressure was strongly dependent
   on the starting point of the hunters, and areas close to the base cabin
   were subject to most hunting activity. Areas furthest away, towards the
   border of the hunting area, experienced little hunting activity.
   5. Logistic regression showed that survival probability of ptarmigan was
   best predicted by distance from the cabin. Shot radio-tagged birds lived
   closer to the cabin, and had twice as high hunting pressure in their
   home range, compared with surviving radio-tagged birds.
   6. This method of obtaining quantitative data about human effort will
   have application in other studies when there is a need to quantify and
   analyse human effort on temporal and spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Within the populations of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus in Stonratn
   and Rungavatn, Norway, fish that attained the largest size in the fate
   parr stage migrated as 4 + smolts, fish that attained a medium size
   became 5 + smolts. and the smallest parr became lake residents. Within
   the last 2 years of the parr stage, those that became anadromous had a
   lower growth rate during the winter and early summer than those that
   became resident, and vice versa in late summer. Thus, anadromous fish
   grew faster in the parr stage, but in years prior to migration, their
   growth pattern seemed to differ from that of parr that became resident.
   Due to early size differences between parr that became anadromous or
   resident, it is suggested that some of the basis for the decision to
   smoltify or not in charr depends on the growth rats through the whole
   parr stage, but with significant modification by the local environment.
   Rungavatn parr had a significantly higher population density (5 x),
   higher lipid content and mortality, an earlier maturation, a lower rate
   of growth, and only one-third the degree of anadromy than those from
   Storvatn. II is suggested that the two charr populations have evolved
   different life-history adaptations due to unequal growth, energy
   allocation and competition opportunities in the lakes. (C) 2000 The

Abstract = {We studied social organization and behavior of arctic foxes (Alopex
   lagopus) in 3 adjacent territories from 1988 to 1995 in central Norway,
   where the major rodent prey were cyclic. Twenty-five foxes were equipped
   with radiotransmitters and several other individuals could be recognized
   visually. Paired adult foxes and their cubs had home ranges that
   overlapped more with each other than with neighboring foxes (37\% versus
   2.9\%) and therefore seemed to be territorial. Family composition varied
   from monogamous pairs, to pairs with additional adults, to an example
   with 2 reproducing females and 1 male in the same den. Presence of
   additional family members was independent of the state of the rodent
   cycle and the reproductive state of the breeding pair. Additional family
   members contributed only 2\% of the food provided to young pups and were
   therefore not regarded as true helpers. Breeding adults remained
   resident within the same territory even in years with low abundance of
   rodents, when they did not breed. All pups left their natal territory by
   6 months of age, although some subsequently returned to their natal
   range or one of the adjacent dens.},

Abstract = {A fine-scale fragmented ar ea (twenty-two 40 x 40 m clear-cuts) and a
   coarse-scale fragmented area (three 150 x 150 m clear-cuts) were created
   in a spruce forest in Norway during 1995-1996. Before and after the
   logging, in 1994 and 1997 respectively, ground beetles were sampled in
   pitfall traps between the clear-cuts and from an untouched control area.
   Seven eurytopic forest species accounted for 99\% of the catch. In the
   fine-scale fragmented area the abundance of Leistus terminatus was
   significantly negatively affected by fragmentation, whereas in the
   coarse-scale fragmented area L. terminatus, Trechus obtusus and Calathus
   micropterus were significantly negatively affected. No clear indications
   of area or edge effects were found. Isolation effects probably were
   minimal. The ambiguity in the explanation of the results is likely to be
   due to species-specific and complex responses to the different aspects
   of habitat fragmentation.},

Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {367-393},
Abstract = {In large-herbivore populations, environmental variation and density
   dependence co-occur and have similar effects on various fitness
   components. Our review aims to quantify the temporal variability of
   fitness components and examine how that variability affects changes in
   population growth rates. Regardless of the source of variation, adult
   female survival shows little year-to-year variation {[}coefficient of
   variation (CV <10\%)], fecundity of prime-aged females and yearling
   survival rates show moderate year-to-year variation (CV <20\%), and
   juvenile survival and fecundity of young females show strong variation
   (CV >30\%). Old females show senescence in both survival and
   reproduction, These patterns of variation are independent of differences
   in body mass, taxonomic group, and ecological conditions. Differences in
   levels of maternal care may fine-tune the temporal variation of early
   survival. The immature stage, despite a low relative impact on
   population growth rate compared with the adult stage, may be the
   critical component of population dynamics of large herbivores. Observed
   differences in temporal variation may be more important than estimated
   relative sensitivity or elasticity in determining the relative
   demographic impact of various fitness components.},

Pages = {33-40},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sea ducks generally are diurnal feeders, but large numbers winter above
   the Arctic Circle where day lengths decrease dramatically in winter. To
   determine how sea ducks cope with short day lengths, we studied
   different aspects of the behavior of three sympatric wintering species
   (Common Eider {[}Somateria mollissima], King Elder {[}S. spectabilis],
   and Oldsquaw {[}Clangula hyemalis]) at 70 degrees N where day length is
   reduced to less than 4.5 h of twilight in midwinter. Numbers of both
   elder species remained fairly constant throughout winter, whereas
   Oldsquaws moved out of the area in midwinter. As day length decreased,
   elders extended their feeding period into lower light intensities.
   Common Elders and Oldsquaws spent a higher proportion of the day diving
   (underwater) when days were short, whereas King Elders did not. As the
   days lengthened, King Elders and Oldsquaws increased their total time
   diving at similar rates, which were faster than those of Common Elders.
   Feeding at lower light intensities and increased proportions of time
   spent diving did not offset reduced feeding time in midwinter, and
   estimated time spent underwater during daylight on the shortest days was
   only 35\% of that on the longest days in King Elders, 51\% in Common
   Elders, and 39\% in Oldsquaws. The ability to survive when days are
   short might be explained by use of stored nutrient reserves, night
   feeding, or high prey availability.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of Pb in livers of willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus), black
   grouse (Tetrao tetrix), and hare (Lepus timidus) were determined in
   samples collected during the period 1990-92 from 77 locations
   distributed across Norway. Our objective was to elucidate the impact of
   long-range atmospheric transport on the Pb exposure of the animals. The
   moss Hylocomium splendens was measured for atmospheric Pb deposition and
   Pb in soil at 60-cm depth was determined to reflect the natural
   geochemical background at the study locations. Strong positive
   relationships were found between Pb in liver and atmospheric deposition
   of Pb for all species and age groups studied. Results indicate that
   long-range atmospheric transport was the main sourer of Pb in the
   animals studied. This conclusion was supported by Pb analysis of typical
   food plants for the animals. Correlation between Pb in liver and Pb in
   soil mineral matter was observed only when considering sites with very
   low impact of atmospheric deposition. Even though the observed liver Pb
   concentrations map seem low (less than or equal to 12 mu g g(-1) dw)
   they approach levels where sub-lethal effects cannot be ignored. (C)

Abstract = {Viability and a seemingly successful breeding of a Fl House Sparrow x
   Tree Sparrow hybrid are reported from islands off the coast of northern
   Norway. From two consecutive clutches of House Sparrow x Tree Sparrow
   hybrids recorded in 1995, only one of 7 chicks survived the first year.
   The surviving individual was later, in 1997. round attending the nest
   with a female House Sparrow and feeding the young in two consecutive
   clutches. Neither of the F2 hybrids were observed after fledging.
   Despite the fact that Mouse Sparrows indulge in frequent extra pair
   copulation, we find it unlikely that both clutches fed by the male
   hybrid could have been fathered by a House Sparrow male and therefore
   conclude that the Fl male hybrid was fertile. The hybridisation may have
   been facilitated by the fragmented structure and small size (from 5 to
   100 individuals) of the sub-populations found in our study area.},

Abstract = {The long-term effects of the 1988 algal bloom (Chrysochromulina
   polylepis Manton et Parke) along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast are
   evaluated and discussed on the basis of several monitoring programmes.
   Effects on individual growth and survival of coastal cod and its
   population dynamics are analysed. Cod suffered a high mortality from
   June until November, and the 1988 year-class was strongly reduced.
   Growth was only slightly affected. Furthermore, the effects at the
   community level are evaluated for the coastal fish community and the
   benthic communities. These communities were strongly affected on a short
   time scale, but recovered surprisingly fast. Populations of most
   organisms had recovered within months, and after 1 yr few traces of the
   toxic bloom could be observed; after 4 to 5 yr all communities had
   essentially recovered. As part of the review we also discuss to what
   extent harmful blooms are Likely to reoccur, and conclude that blooms
   have reoccurred and will continue to do so. However, nothing can be
   concluded about the toxicity of such blooms. We expect that even large
   perturbations are unlikely to leave any profound long-lasting effects.
   The effects of the 1988 bloom are discussed within a theoretical
   framework including stability, resilience and inertia. In conclusion we
   emphasise the importance of long-term monitoring data; without such data
   the analyses reported in this paper would have been impossible.},

Title = {Plant communities in broad-leaved deciduous forests in Hordaland county,

Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {449-466},
Abstract = {The vegetation of broad-leaved deciduous forests in Hordaland Western
   Norway is described with regards to species composition and structure.
   The investigation is based on phytosociological analyses of native
   forest stands dominated by Corylus avellana, Fraxinus excelsior, Ulmus
   glabra, or Tilia cordata. Two-way-indicator analysis (TWINSPAN) and
   correspondence analysis (CA) are used to distinguish different
   vegetation types and assess possible gradients in the vegetation data.
   The vegetation types are discussed in relation to equivalent forest
   communities and to syntaxonomical units. Two forest types are described
   at the first hierarchical TWINSPAN level: 1) A hygrophilous and slightly
   thermophilous Fraxinus excelsior-Cirriphyllum piliferum forest
   characterised by an open tree canopy, a dense field layer of tall herbs
   and ferns, and a high cover of bryophytes. 2) A thermophilous and less
   hygrophilous Corylus avellana-Brachypodium sylvaticum forest
   characterised by a dense tree layer, a more open field layer with larger
   elements of small herbs, and a somewhat lower bryophyte cover. The CA
   analysis clearly separates the samples from the first TWINSPAN division
   along the first ordination axis. Five forest types have been described
   at the second hierarchical level, mainly associated with differences in
   mesotrophic and eutrophic species, but there is clearly a gradient
   structure in the species composition between these plant communities. In
   relation to syntaxonomy, the first TWINSPAN division supports the
   separation of the west Norwegian broad-leaved deciduous forests into a
   hygrophilous plant community, the Eurhynchio-Fraxinetum (Blom 1982)
   Ovstedal 1985 and a drier and more thermophilous community, the
   Primulo-Ulmetum (Blom 1982) Ovstedal 1985.},

Journal = {ORNIS FENNICA},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {117-129},
Abstract = {Two nests of breeding goshawks were monitored by means of time-lapse
   video monitoring in boreal coniferous forests in Central Norway in 1996.
   One was located in a large-scale forestry area, the other in a mixed
   agricultural/forestry area. Altogether 311 prey items were registered
   during 915 hours of recordings and 75 remain items were collected at or
   near the nests. About 70\% of the prey were identified to family level
   or higher from video, but species identification was more difficult. In
   contrast, ca. 85\% of remain items were identified to species level. The
   video method proved superior in detecting unfeathered young and small
   prey, and it was fairly reliable and involved little disturbance.
   Thrush-sized birds (fledglings/juveniles) were the dominating prey
   group. Line transects showed a high abundance of thrush-sized
   passerines, but low densities of larger prey. At the first site the
   proportions between prey groups found by video corresponded to those
   from line transects. At the second site there was a significant
   preference for thrush-sized birds, and the overall prey density there
   was twice that of the first area. Significantly larger prey were brought
   to the nests in the last part of the breeding season when both parents
   hunted, compared to the early part when the male was hunting alone.
   Video monitoring is a valuable tool for studying the food brought to the
   nest by raptors, as it is able to provide better quantitative
   information on prey selection and the differences between the sexes
   regarding hunting effort and prey choice.},

Abstract = {There are several well-documented examples of multiple hybrid origins of
   polyploid species. Herein we report the first, to our knowledge,
   explicit example of a species that most probably has originated
   recurrently by diploid hybrid speciation. Genetic relationships and
   stabilization of two Argyranthemum populations of putative hybrid origin
   on Tenerife, the Canary Islands, were investigated using chromosomal,
   morphometric, and fertility analyses of cultivated progeny families and
   artificial Fl and Fz hybrids. These data were compared to a recently
   published chloroplast DNA phylogeny of the genus, in which the same
   populations were included. The results suggest that the two populations
   must be referred to a single species, A. sundingii, which is diploid,
   fully fertile, genetically stabilized, and occurs in an ecologically
   intermediate habitat opened by deforestation, and that this species has
   originated at least twice following local hybridization in two valleys.
   The same parental species were involved in each origin; the montane A.
   broussonetii and the coastal A. frutescens. The montane species was the
   chloroplast donor in one of the valleys and the coastal species in the
   other.},

Abstract = {Methodological problems in describing patterns of senescence in wild
   populations have until recently impeded progress in understanding the
   evolution of a process that decreases individual fitness, We
   investigated age- and sex-specific survival in five populations of three
   species of ungulates (roe deer, Capreolus capreolus; bighorn sheep, Ovis
   canadensis; and isard, Rupicapra pyrenaica), using recent statistical
   developments of capture-mark-recapture models and long-term (12 to 22
   yr) data on marked individuals. The yearly survival of females aged 2-7
   yr was remarkably similar and very high (92-95\%) in all five
   populations. Survival of adult males varied among species and
   populations. Survival decreased from 8 yr onward for both sexes in all
   populations, suggesting that senescence was a common phenomenon. Male
   survival was lower than female survival, and the gender difference
   increased with age. The extent of sex differences in survival was
   related neither to sexual dimorphism in mass nor to the level of
   polygyny, suggesting that species differences in social behavior,
   particularly mating system and the level of male-male aggression, may be
   more important than simply the level of polygyny in explaining sexual
   differences in survival. Our results underline the advantages of
   long-term monitoring of marked individuals for the study of evolutionary
   ecology.},

Abstract = {The accumulation and distribution of cadmium (Cd) were studied in willow
   ptarmigan from a mountainous area in Central Norway. The highest
   concentrations were found in the kidneys. The liver also accumulated
   substantial amounts, but heart and breast muscles had low
   concentrations. There was a significant correlation between the Cd
   content and age in all tissues. The liver and kidneys showed a rapid
   increase in Cd content during the ptarmigan's first autumn and winter,
   but the accumulation seemed to level off when the bird passed its first
   year of life. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found among all
   four tissues, the strongest being between liver and kidneys, and the
   weakest between heart muscle and breast muscle. The ratio of cadmium in
   liver to cadmium in kidney was less than 1, which indicates a chronic
   low-level exposure situation. This ratio varied among seasons, being
   significantly higher in winter/spring than in summer/autumn. In general,
   the Cd content in the kidneys was approximately 7-10 times that of the
   liver. Breast muscle had a very low Cd content when the concentration of
   cadmium in the kidney was less than 75-80 mg kg(-1) of Cd, but the
   content increased markedly when the kidney contained more Cd than this.},

   northern Norway. The flow regime in this river is typical for northern
   rivers.
   2. There was considerable variation in year class strength of both
   species.
   3. Mortality of Atlantic Salmon increased significantly in years with
   high discharge during the alevin stage as well as the first week after
   emergence. High discharge during the egg stage and more than 1 week
   after emergence seemed to be of minor importance. Water temperature at
   emergence was rather high (average 10.5 degrees C) and did not
   significantly affect year class strength.
   4. Brown Trout emerged earlier than Atlantic Salmon at an average water
   temperature of 8.2 degrees C. Highest mortality was observed in years
   with low water temperatures at emergence as well as high discharge
   during the alevin stage.
   5. For 1-year-old fish or older, the size of the spring peak flood did
   not influence mortality significantly.
   6. Growth of Atlantic Salmon parr was diminished in years with a high
   peak spring flood. A similar effect on Brown Trout was not detected.},

Title = {Factors associated with wolverine Gulo gulo predation on domestic sheep},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {963-973},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Following a long history of eradication campaigns against predators,
   wolverine Gulo gulo distribution and numbers became critically low in
   Norway in the 1960s. Consequently, wolverines were protected by law
   during the 1970s and 1980s. This led to an increase in wolverine numbers
   and re-establishment in some formerly occupied habitats, resulting in
   increased depredation on domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus and sheep
   Ovis aries. Wolverine control and licensed hunting have been used
   increasingly as tools to reduce the depredation since protection was
   introduced. However, the factors influencing the level of this
   depredation have not been studied. We therefore examined losses of
   domestic sheep grazing unattended on upland summer ranges in the
   Snohetta plateau of south central Norway during 1979-94, in relation to
   wolverine population numbers, reproduction and control measures. This
   area was recently re-occupied by wolverines and reproduction has been
   recorded regularly from the beginning of the study period.
   2. The number of ewes and lambs recorded in organized grazing areas
   increased more than fivefold during the period, and losses increased
   proportionally with sheep numbers. The differences in losses among
   municipalities and grazing co-operatives were probably related to sheep
   breeds and local variation in wolverine density.
   3. The heavy Dala sheep breed was most at risk, whereas losses from the
   lighter Norwegian short-tailed and Norwegian fur-bearing breeds were
   lower than expected.
   4. Killing of wolverines led to fewer lambs being lost in the same year
   that the wolverine killing took place, but the effect quickly declined,
   implying a rapid re-establishment of wolverines in the local area.
   5. Lambs were more vulnerable to wolverine predation than ewes, and
   losses were higher in wolverine cub-rearing areas than in the area as a
   whole.
   6. We conclude that: (i) control programmes for wolverines, as practised
   today, will have little long-term effect in reducing sheep losses,
   unless wolverines are eradicated or severely reduced in numbers; (ii)
   the introduction of more agile sheep breeds will probably reduce losses;
   (iii) in areas where wolverine control to protect sheep is a threat
   towards wolverine conservation, the present sheep husbandry system of
   grazing unguarded sheep in the mountains should be replaced by
   alternative forms that provide the sheep with more protection. This is
   particularly important in wolverine denning areas.},

Abstract = {Brown trout in Lake Femund migrated from the nursery streams mainly at 2
   years old, but ranging between 1 and 8 years. Brown trout switched to
   piscivory from 3 years onwards, and a body length of 17.5 cm, according
   to back calculation from scales. Fast growers switched to piscivory at a
   younger age and smaller size than slow growers. The most slow-growing
   trout switched to fish feeding at 9 years old and a mean body length of
   36 cm. The growth of the invertebrate feeders was almost rectilinear to
   c. 45 cm and 11 years of age. Switching to a fish diet induced increased
   growth rates. Age at sexual maturity increased with the age at which the
   fish became piscivorous. The invertebrate feeders matured at an age
   similar to that of the most fast growing piscivorous trout. The
   mortality rate of sub-adults and adults did not differ significantly
   between fish and invertebrate feeding trout. Longevity of piscivorous
   trout was estimated at 11 years and of invertebrate feeders at 10 years.

Abstract = {The predation behaviour of six lynx Lynx lynx family groups, i.e. adult
   females with dependent kittens, was studied using radio-tracking and
   snow-tracking in the Sarek area of northern Sweden during winter 1995/96
   and 1996/97. One hundred and six daily radio-locations were obtained,
   and 340 km of intervening tracks were followed in the snow. Forty-one
   seats were collected, and 57 hunting attempts, 37 of which were
   successful, were recorded. Semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus
   contributed over 90\% to lynx ingested meat calculated from both seats
   and kills. Eighty-three percent of hunting attempts on reindeer, and
   53\% of attempts on small prey species, mainly Lagopus sp. and mountain
   hares Lepus timidus, were successful. Four incidents of multiple-killing
   of reindeer were documented. Reindeer were generally in poor body
   condition, with an average femur marrow fat content of 27\%. Lynx spent
   an average of three nights at each reindeer kill-site. Reindeer were
   less completely consumed than small prey (61\% vs 99\%). The amount of
   meat eaten from a reindeer was proportional to the number of lynx-nights
   on the kill. An overall kill rate of one reindeer per five days was
   calculated. We concluded that reindeer are a very important food source
   for lynx in winter, which potentially could lead to problems in
   resolving the carnivore-livestock conflicts in the region.},

Abstract = {We explore some of the consequences of harvest on population growth
   rate, age and sex structure in a Norwegian population of red deer Cervus
   elaphus, using age-structured demographic models. Survival rates were
   estimated from individuals marked and monitored annually during
   1977-1995, and information about reproduction patterns were obtained
   from hunting material in the same region. The population had an actual
   doubling time of 14 years, corresponding to a multiplication rate of
   1.051. Harvesting led to a reduction of about 10\% of the potential
   multiplication rate that equalled 1.166. Including stochasticity had
   only a small effect on the population multiplication rate. Due to a high
   hunting pressure, males had less than a 10\% chance of reaching 4.5
   years of age and the male-biased harvest strongly biased the sex ratio.
   Assuming that when the number of females per male increases above a
   given threshold some females would not manage to mate, we investigated
   at which level male harvesting could be maintained without having
   demographic consequences on the population growth rate. We concluded
   that the hunting pressure on males could probably be increased further
   but indirect consequences of a strongly biased sex ratio (e.g. on
   population genetic structure) remain to be studied. Variation in the
   multiplication rate mainly resulted from the variation in winter calf
   survival. In its present form the harvesting regime reduces the growth
   rate and biases the sex and age structure, but does not seem to threaten
   the population's viability and productivity.},

   fields offered greater concealment than those in the forest, where there
   were no detectable differences between stand age classes. Compositional
   analysis revealed a significant preference for bed-sites to be located
   in forest, although fields and bogs were often used. Within the forest,
   stands of all age classes were used. The broad use of habitats may

Abstract = {The suitability of intraperitoneally implanted radio-transmitters as a

   conditions. Radio-marked adult females were followed to the lair where
   they kept their kittens. In 1997 and 1998, nine kittens (4-5 weeks old)
   were located. One of two implant models (7 g and 20 g) were implanted
   using surgical procedures and a combination of medetomidine (0.08 mg/kg)
   and ketamine (5 mg/kg) for anaesthesia. No complications occurred during
   the operations. All kittens were accepted again by their mother and were
   moved to a new lair within 1 km. All survived at least three months
   after the operation. Six of the kittens were re-examined 4-5 months
   after the operation. In all of these cases the implants were floating
   freely in the peritoneal cavity. Based on these results it appears that
   intraperitoneal implanting of radio-transmitters is a very useful method
   for studying very young lynx kittens, and could be used for most felids
   of a similar, or larger, size.},

   the golden eagle on semidomestic reindeer in central Norway using
   mortality-sensing radiocollars mounted on 853 reindeer. We observed 9
   calf and 3 adult female deaths from golden eagle predation. Under

Abstract = {The concept of critical loads has been widely accepted as a basis for
   designing control strategies to reduce regional air pollution. Data from
   the ``1000 lake survey{''} carried out in Norway in 1986 were used to
   derive a dose-response function for the probability of damage to fish
   populations as a function of the critical load exceedance, by means of a
   logistic regression model for fish damage. A corresponding function
   based on a fish damage database (brown trout, arctic char, and perch)
   and the national critical load database for Norway compared well with
   the derived dose-response function. When the critical load is not
   exceeded there is only a very small probability that the fish population
   will be damaged, but when the critical load is exceeded the chance of
   damage increases with the amount of exceedance. At critical load the
   probability of damage to fish populations is about 20. These results
   confirm that the critical load concept is a strong tool for estimating
   the extent of biological damage caused by long-range transported air
   pollution, and that prognoses based on this method can give reliable
   estimates of the extent of fish damage under future scenarios of acidic

Abstract = {Differences in diet and patch choices of African elephants (Loxodonta
   africana) according to sex and herd structure were examined during the
   dry season in a dystrophic savanna-woodland ecosystem in northern
   Botswana. The study revealed that female elephants with dependent young
   fed more selectively than the very large adult males, as indicated by
   the large number of woody plant species utilised, in order to minimise
   fibre intake, at both the woody plant species level and the
   feeding-patch level. Adult females fed on more woody plant species per
   unit area in patches containing higher numbers of such plants than adult
   males. Family units also browsed on more woody plant species per unit
   area and in total than adult males. Finally, family units discriminated
   between patches in their surroundings and selected patches offering the
   highest density of palatable species, whereas males were apparently
   ignorant of the distribution of resources in their environment and
   browsed in patches containing the same amount and combination of species
   as surrounding areas. This suggests that body size is a paramount factor
   mediating dietary differences between the sexes in African elephants at
   both the feeding-patch and the woody plant species level. These findings
   are consistent with the sexual dimorphism - body size hypothesis, which
   states that an increase in body size leads to a relaxation of the
   requirement for selectivity in feeding.},

Abstract = {The magnitude of fitness variation caused by maternal effects and, thus,
   the adaptive significance of maternal traits may depend on environmental
   quality, generating crossing reaction norms among offspring phenotypes
   that shape life-history evolution. By manipulating intraclutch variation
   in egg size and comparing siblings we examined the maternal effects of
   egg size on offspring performance and tested for the existence of
   reaction norms to environmental quality using the brown trout Salmo
   trutta. When sibling groups of small and large eggs were reared
   separately in a hatchery environment initial size differences
   disappeared rapidly. However, in semi-natural environments and under
   direct competition, juveniles from large eggs experienced growth and
   survival advantages over siblings from small eggs. Moreover, distinct
   reaction norms existed, with the differences in performance of juveniles
   from small and large eggs being most pronounced in the poorer growth
   environments. Our results provide the first direct evidence, to our
   knowledge, for a causal relationship between egg size and
   fitness-related traits in fishes, independent of potentially confounding
   genetic effects. Moreover, they indicate that previous studies have been
   biased by experimental conditions that excluded competitive asymmetries
   and environmental variability. The existence of reaction norms indicates
   a shift in optimal egg size across gradients of environmental quality
   that probably shapes the evolution of this trait.},

Abstract = {Individual egg mass and fecundity increased with somatic mass in first
   time and repeat spawning wild anadromous and freshwater resident brown
   trout Salmo trutta. The egg mass was larger for similar-sized trout in
   south (58 degrees N) than mid Norway (63 degrees N), whereas fecundity
   was higher in mid- than in south Norway, making total gonadal investment
   similar in the two areas. Repeat spawners had heavier eggs than
   similar-sized first time spawners. The egg mass of residents was c. 10\%
   larger than that of similar-sized first time spawning anadromous trout.
   Common garden experiments with offspring of wild anadromous trout showed
   no significant correlation between egg and somatic mass in first time
   spawners in two of the three populations studied. In the third
   population, a slight positive correlation was found. Similar results
   were found for repeat spawners. In the three populations, fecundity
   increased significantly with somatic mass in both first time and repeat
   spawners. Wild and hatchery-reared trout showed negative correlation
   between egg mass and fecundity when the effect of body size was
   excluded, indicating a trade-off between the two parameters. In wild
   trout, this was caused by variation among populations, whereas in
   hatchery fish, within population Variation was observed in egg mass over
   fecundity. Furthermore, the egg mass of first time and repeat spawners
   were positively correlated, when adjusted for fish size. Size-specific
   gonadal investment was significantly higher in wild anadromous than
   resident trout. There was no significant difference in gonadal
   investment between first time and repeat spawners in wild anadromous
   trout. However, in the hatchery-reared trout, gonadal investment was
   significantly higher at repeat than first time maturation. The hatchery
   trout did not spawn naturally, but were artificially stripped. Among
   populations, a part of the variation in egg mass and fecundity is
   phenotypically plastic, a part appears genetically determined. (C) 1999

Abstract = {During the austral summer of 1996/1997 we studied south polar skuas at
   Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica,:where the world's largest
   known colony of Antarctic petrels is found. Our censuses suggested
   approximately 250 full-grown skuas and 140,000 breeding pairs of petrels
   were present. During their breeding season, skuas did not visit the open
   sea at least 200 km from the site; they relied entirely on prey caught
   and scavenged from the petrel colony. Because the site is so isolated,
   we asked whether the prey (petrels) had swamped the predators (skuas),
   or whether there was evidence that predator numbers were limited by the
   size of the prey population. Particularly at the end of the petrel
   incubation period, we found a close correspondence between the energy
   required by adult skuas and their chicks, ascertained from time budget
   studies, and the rate at which petrel eggs disappeared from the colony.
   This suggests that, in this closed system, the predator population was
   limited by the prey population, and that predator swamping was not an
   advantage that petrels gained by nesting in this remote location.},

Abstract = {Winter home ranges of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) were censused,

   Isere (France). Based on 1 700 points characterized by 7 environmental

   A statistical analysis (logistic linear model) showed that snow-cover,
   vegetation, exposition, and relief were the most reliable variables
   characteristic of chamois winter habitat. Altitude and slope were less
   significant.
   The first four variables were thus retained to characterize chamois
   winter habitat according to the biogeographical unit of each massif:
   Northern Prealps, outer crystalline massifs, Southern Prealps.
   Importance of snow-cover varied according to the massif: Northern
   Prealps winter habitat was characterized by a long lasting snow-cover
   whereas in the massifs, snow-cover disappeared more rapidly. Most
   commonly the chamois selected forests, and also rather uniforme reliefs.
   Winter habitats tended to be North-facing in the Prealps, and
   South-facing in inner massifs.},

Abstract = {An important component of the parasite fauna of seabirds in arctic
   regions are the flukes (Digena). Different species of digeneans have
   life cycles which may consist of 1 intermediate host and no free-living
   larval stages, 2 intermediate hosts and 1 free-living stage, or 2
   intermediate hosts and 2 free-living larval stages. This study examined
   the distribution of such parasites in the intertidal zones of the
   southern coast of the Barents Sea (northwestern Russia and northern
   Norway) by investigating 2 species of periwinkles (Littorina saxatilis
   and L. obtusata) which are intermediate hosts of many species of
   digeneans. A total of 26020 snails from 134 sampling stations were
   collected. The study area was divided into 5 regions, and the number of
   species, frequency of occurrence and prevalence of different digenean
   species and groups of species (depending on life cycle complexity) were
   compared among these regions, statistically controlling for
   environmental exposure. We found 14 species of digeneans, of which 13
   have marine birds as final hosts. The number of species per sampling
   station increased westwards, and was higher on the Norwegian coast than
   on the Russian coast. The frequency of occurrence of digeneans with more
   than 1 intermediate host increased westwards, making up a larger
   proportion of the digeneans among infected snails. This was significant
   in L, saxatilis. The prevalence of different species showed the same
   pattern, and significantly more snails of both species were infected
   with digeneans with complicated life cycles in the western regions. In
   L, saxatilis, environmental exposure had a statistically significant
   effect on the distribution of the most common digenean species. This was
   less obvious in L. obtusata. The causes of changing species composition
   between regions are probably (1) the harsh climate in the eastern part
   of the study area reducing the probability of successful transmission of
   digeneans with complicated life cycles, and (2) the distribution of
   different final hosts.},

Abstract = {The rapid economic growth in China has been accompanied by a
   corresponding increase in pollution. In this paper the extent and
   effects of acid precipitation and precursors are discussed based on
   field observations and literature studies. Sulfur dioxide emissions are
   at present the major cause of acid precipitation, but emissions of
   nitrogen oxides are increasing. The deposition of sulfur compounds in
   the most polluted areas in China is higher than in those parts of
   Eastern and Central Europe which are experiencing severe pollution.
   Soils and soil waters seem to be acidified in many areas in southern
   China. Pollution has affected the vitality of forests and other
   vegetation particularly in and close to urban areas. Surface water
   acidification is not likely to become a major regional problem in the
   near future, but streams in some areas, which currently receive little
   acid deposition, appear to be sensitive to acidification.},

Abstract = {Between 1988 and 1995, dens in three adjacent arctic fox (Alopex
   lagopus) territories were monitored in an alpine environment in
   south-central Norway (the Snohetta plateau). A total of 675 seats were
   collected at dens in both winter and summer, and the numbers of resident
   adults and pups at emergence were counted each summer. Small rodents
   (mainly Lemmus sp, and Microtus sp.) were the most frequently consumed
   prey and made up the greatest volume within seats, in ail seasons and at
   all stages of the rodent cycle. Small rodents were followed in frequency
   by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), hares (Lepus timidus), birds, and
   vegetation. Birds and vegetation were more common in the summer diet
   than in the winter diet, reflecting their seasonal availability. The
   relative volume of reindeer and birds in the diet decreased with
   increasing rodent abundance. Increased pup production was associated
   with years of high rodent abundance and a high occurrence of rodents in
   the diet. Adult numbers were not associated with rodent abundance.},

Abstract = {The area along the Norwegian-Russian border is threatened by air
   pollution from emission sources on the Kola Peninsula. A permanent
   network of 78 systematically chosen monitoring sites has been
   established in eastern Finnmark, Norway. Species abundance data from the
   ground vegetation have been recorded from 1320 systematically chosen
   permanent plots inside 66 of these sites, using frequency in subplots
   and visual estimates of percentage cover. Environmental variables were
   obtained for the whole site. Multivariate data analysis has been used to
   describe the variation in the species composition and to study its
   relation to environmental variables and pollution impact. The analyses
   show that much of the variation in the species composition, based on
   average species abundance at the sites, is well explained by different
   soil and climatic conditions. However, estimated SO2 deposition, Ni, and
   Cu in the soil, and Ni in Cladina tissue have also been found to be
   statistically significantly correlated with the variation in the species
   data, but they explain only a minor part of the variation. The pollution
   impact over several years may have lead to a reduced lichen cover in the
   bottom-layer vegetation. Further development in an either negative or
   positive direction can be detected by re-investigations of the
   monitoring sites.},

Abstract = {Multi-sea-winter Atlantic salmon (75-115 cm fork length L-F, 2-4-winter

   1992-1993, and 130 fish entered the large subarctic River Tana (Teno).
   They entered the fresh water at any time of the tidal cycle but more so
   during the high and ebbing tides. No diel rhythm was detected in river
   entry under polar day conditions. There were no differences in the
   change of flow between days when salmon moved and when they did not, but
   during active migration increasing discharge was associated with
   increased swimming activity of salmon, especially later in the summer.
   Increasing air temperature was also associated with enhanced migration
   activity. Low river flow was associated with increasing delay in salmon
   passing the first riffle area of the river, 35 km from the sea. (C) 1999

Title = {An impact of genetic variation and predation on chick survival in willow
   ptarmigan Lagopus l. lagopus},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {129-135},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The present study investigates the determinants of chick survival in
   willow ptarmigan Lagopus l. lagopus. Chick survival was negatively
   associated with genetic relatedness of mates, This may imply that more
   chicks die when genetic relatedness of mates is high, i.e. low chick
   heterozygosity at hatching. Hence, newly hatched chicks with low
   heterozygosity may have reduced viability and, therefore, might suffer
   higher mortality due to biotic/abiotic conditions. However, there was no
   association between the proportion of chicks with low heterozygosity and
   ambient temperature, but a highly significant association with predation
   pressure was found. Because newly hatched chicks are unable to maintain
   their body temperature even at normal ambient temperatures and because
   willow ptarmigan chicks start chirping when they get cold, it is
   suggested that chicks with low genetic variation may become more exposed
   to predation, It is proposed that genetic variation significantly
   affects viability of ptarmigan chicks, but that predation is the
   proximate cause of death. Consistent with several earlier studies,
   predation was related both to nesting females and to survival of the
   chicks. However, the present study extends these findings by suggesting
   a relationship between predation on one side and genetic constitution on
   the other, and that predation on nesting females, by reducing genetic
   variation among chicks at hatching, enhance chick mortality.},

Title = {Multiannual fluctuations in willow ptarmigan Lagopus l. lagopus - does
   the genetic variation of nesting females enhance the effect of
   predation?},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Willow ptarmigan Lagopus l. lagopus is a popular game bird which
   fluctuates in abundance. The causes of these fluctuations, however,
   remain controversial, but several studies have emphasised the effect of
   predation. Predation not only reduces the number of breeding birds, but
   does it in such a way that genetic variation among chicks at hatching
   becomes reduced, causing reduced viability and increased mortality among
   chicks. We present an extended predation hypothesis in which the
   multiannually fluctuating population dynamics of the willow ptarmigan
   are better explained by a model including both predation and genetic
   variation of territorial nesting females than by predation alone. A
   simple model including the heterozygosity of nesting territorial females
   and the percentage of females suffering egg predation explained 95\% of
   the observed fluctuations in chick production on an inland study area
   during five years, whereas predation alone only explained 72\%. The data
   may suggest a non-additive relationship between predation and genetic
   variation of nesting females which enhance the effect of predation.
   Observed and calculated chick production per two adults deviated on
   average by only 0.38 chicks. In another inland population, showing
   multiannual fluctuations for almost 20 years, observed and calculated
   chick production deviated on average by 0.58 chicks, and the model
   explained 61\% of observed fluctuations in chick production, whereas
   predation alone only explained 28\%. In an island population, however,
   the full model explained 45\% of observed fluctuations in chick
   production. This was about the same as predation alone (44\%). It is
   discussed whether the better fit of the full model than the model
   including predation alone between observed and calculated chick
   production obtained in the two inland populations in contrast to the
   island population, may be caused by the different predator communities.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Following over-harvest in the early decades of the 20th century, the
   arctic fox Alopex lagopus has declined and failed to recover in Norway.
   Competition with the red fox Vulpes vulpes has frequently been suggested
   as a possible factor hindering arctic fox recovery. Between 1988 and
   1997, a total of 213 former arctic fox dens in four alpine regions of
   Norway, i.e. Hardangervidda, Dovrefjell, Borgefjell and Dividalen, were
   checked at least once for occupation by red or arctic foxes. Of these
   213 former arctic fox dens, 138 were unoccupied, and 32 and 43 were
   occupied by arctic and red foxes, respectively. In general, red foxes
   occupied dens situated at significantly lower altitudes than those
   occupied by arctic foxes, which supports present ideas of red fox/arctic
   fox coexistence. As arctic foxes tended to avoid dens at the lowest
   altitudes, it is possible that arctic foxes to some degree avoid the
   areas where red foxes are most abundant. This may have disproportionate
   effects, as the probability of reproduction in arctic fox dens was
   highest in dens at lower altitudes. Despite this, the large number of
   unoccupied dens indicates that dens are unlikely to be in limited
   supply. Therefore, neither our data, nor a review of published data and
   trapping records, support the hypothesis that inter-specific competition
   with the red fox is currently preventing arctic fox recovery in the
   Norwegian alpine environment.},

Abstract = {In this study, the time-dependent P450 response to oral benzo{[}a]pyrene
   exposure at 1 and 10 degrees C was investigated in winter- and
   summer-acclimated Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). In both seasons, a
   strong induction of CYP1A activities and protein levels (measured only
   in the winter experiment) were seen at both 1 and 10 degrees C. At 1
   degrees C, the responses were delayed and more long-lasting than at 10
   degrees C. No within-season difference between 1 and 10 degrees C in the
   magnitude of the induction response was found, but due to elevated
   baseline CYP1A activities, the induction response was seven times lower
   in winter- as compared with the response in summer-acclimated Arctic
   char. The results show that the CYP1A enzymes of the Arctic char respond
   to temperature changes in a compensatory way, and they are promising
   with respect to the applicability of the P450 enzyme system of the
   Arctic char as a biomarker for monitoring polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon contamination in high-latitude environments. More studies
   are needed, however, to reveal seasonal differences in the biomarker
   response to pollutants.},

Title = {A meta-analysis of fluctuating asymmetry in relation to heterozygosity},
Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {83},
Number = {2},
Pages = {206-218},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetry, the random departure from perfect bilateral
   symmetry, is a common measure of developmental instability that has been
   hypothesized to be inversely correlated with heterozygosity. Although
   this claim has been widely repeated, several studies have reported no
   such association. Therefore, we test the generality of this association,
   using meta-analysis, by converting test statistics for the relationship
   between heterozygosity (H) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) into a common
   effect size, the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. We
   have analysed a database containing 41 studies with a total of 118
   individual samples. Overall we found an unweighted mean negative effect
   size; r = -0.09 (i.e. a negative correlation between H and FA).
   Significant heterogeneity in effect size was mainly caused by a
   difference between ectothermic and endothermic animals, and to a lesser
   extent by the use of different study designs (i.e. within-population vs.
   among-populations). Mean effect size for endothermic animals was
   positive and significantly different from the mean effect size for
   ectothermic animals. Only for within-population studies of ectothermic
   animals did we find a significantly negative effect size (r= -0.23 +/-
   0.09). The distribution of effect sizes in relation to sample size
   provided little evidence for patterns typical of those produced by
   publication bias. Our analysis suggests, at best, only a weak
   association between H and FA, and heterozygosity seems to explain only a
   very small amount of the variation in developmental instability among
   individuals and populations (r(2) = 0.01 for the total material).},

Title = {Delayed maturation in female bank voles: optimal decision or social

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {68},

Abstract = {1. Density, maturation and survival of female bank vole (Clethrionomys
   glareolus) in the northern taiga of Finnish Lapland were studied using
   long-term capture-mark-recapture data from two large grids, one
   food-addition grid and one control grid, in 1982-94.
   2. The density on the food grid was consistently higher than the density
   on the control grid.
   3. Females born early in the breeding season usually matured, except at
   very high densities. Those born later in the summer season commonly
   delayed maturation to the following spring.
   4. Winter survival of sub-adult (having delayed maturation) females was
   significantly higher than survival of adult (breeding) females. However,
   empirical values of subadult and adult survival, as well as difference
   between them, were not consistent with survival values assumed in
   theoretical models on optimal deferred breeding.
   5. There was a density-dependent relationship between the maturation
   rate of young voles and the density of already established breeding
   females (both bank voles and all Clethrionomys together; C. rutilus and
   C. rufocanus occasionally occurred on the study grids). This density
   dependence was different for the two grids (weaker on the food-addition
   grid).
   6. These findings are discussed within an evolutionary context: we have,
   on the basis of these findings, no evidence suggesting that the observed
   delayed maturation represents an evolutionary optimal strategy. Rather,
   there is evidence suggesting that the delay is due to social
   constraints.},

Title = {Juvenile migration in brown trout: a consequence of energetic state},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {783-793},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. We explored the mechanisms determining age and size at juvenile
   migration in brown trout Salmo trutta L. A Cs-133 tracer methodology was
   used to estimate food consumption of juvenile brown trout in a Norwegian
   stream, and the energy budgets of early migrants and stream residents
   were compared.
   2. Fast-growing brown trout migrated to the lake earlier and at a
   smaller body size than slower-growing individuals. The 2+ migrants were
   significantly larger than those that remained 1 or more years longer in
   the stream. The 3+ migrants were significantly larger than the 2+
   migrants. Some fast-growing males matured in the stream, whereas all
   females left the stream before maturing sexually.
   3. The food consumption and the energy budgets for 2+ migrants were more
   than four times higher than those of the resident 2+ fish. Total energy
   allocated to growth was also higher among migrants, and the total
   metabolic costs were five times higher among migrants than among
   resident fish.
   4. The proportional energy allocation to growth among the 2+ migrants
   was much lower (about half) than that of those remaining longer in the
   stream. The reduction in the proportion of energy available for growth
   from age 1+ to 2+ was larger among migrants (88\%) than among resident
   fish (68\%). Reduction in the proportion of energy available for growth
   is a probable explanation for why migrations are initiated at age 2.
   5. Our study supports the hypothesis that fast-growing individuals shift
   their niche earlier and at a smaller body size than slower-growing
   individuals because they maintain higher metabolic rates and are
   energetically constrained at a younger age by limited food resources
   than slow growers.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar.) juveniles were electrofished along a
   300-m stretch of a river to test for possible associations between
   genetic similarity and geographical distance between individuals.
   Multilocus DNA fingerprinting showed that genetically similar juveniles
   (1-4 years old) were found closer together in the river than less
   related individuals. However, the association between genetic similarity
   and geographical distance, although significant, was not strong. This
   may indicate that factors other than genetic relatedness influence the
   positioning in the river. A sex bias in the relationship between genetic
   similarity and geographical distance was caused by a difference between
   sexually mature and immature males. The study shows that sampling of
   salmon juveniles should be spread over a wide stretch of the river in
   order to avoid sampling relatives. Moreover, by including several year
   classes, the overall degree of genetic similarity is effectively reduced
   compared with sampling individuals of similar age. (C) 1999 The

Abstract = {We studied the effects of male disruptive behaviour on female mate
   choice and male mating success in the great snipe, Gallinago media, a
   lekking bird. Harassment from neighbouring males, a widespread behaviour
   in lekking animals, was the most prevalent cause of females leaving a
   male territory. Several lines of evidence show that females did not
   prefer to mate with males able to protect them from harassment. Males
   that obtained mating success were no less likely to suffer disruptions
   and females were no less likely to be disrupted when with their
   preferred male. Females returned to the male they later mated with,
   despite being repeatedly chased away by neighbours. The probability that
   an individual female returned and solicited mating from a male was 15
   times higher for the male she was chased away from compared to the
   neighbour that chased her away. Females returned as often or more to the
   territory owner after being disrupted, compared to after leaving the
   territory without being harassed. Our results suggest that female great
   snipes are extremely choosy, but also that females do not gain direct
   benefits (harassment avoidance) by mating with certain males. Females
   appear to have neither direct nor indirect preferences for dominance
   that could give them such benefits-females appeared choosy despite, not
   because of, harassment. If females gain indirect benefits (genetically
   superior offspring) by being choosy, this is also likely to be unrelated
   to any dominance among males.},

Abstract = {This study presents a model of a forager searching for prey in a
   stochastic hierarchical patch system where high-density patches at small
   scales are nested within low-density patches at larger scales. In order
   to track the system, the forager uses long travel distances within
   large-scale patches and short travel distances within small-scale
   patches. The forager estimates its position in the system according to
   recent experience and changes its search pattern accordingly. The
   scaling of the prey system was adapted according to marine pelagic
   systems of krill and schooling fish, and a forager was simulated for
   varying prey abundance and prey aggregation. The model suggests that
   tracking efficiency, defined as the forager's mean position within the
   system, increases for increasing prey abundance. Furthermore, the model
   suggests that maximum tracking efficiency is found at intermediate prey
   aggregations and that tracking efficiency decreases for aggregations
   above and below this point. The model demonstrates that a
   well-structured hierarchical patch system with high general prey density
   might potentially increase the information flow and, hence, the tracking
   efficiency of a predator. It is suggested that these results might be
   applicable to a wide array of systems where predators track
   unpredictable hierarchical patch systems.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {405-413},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Vendace Coregonus albula have recently invaded the Pasvik River system,
   a subarctic watercourse on the borderline between Norway and Russia,
   after having been introduced into the Finnish headwaters in the
   1950-1960s. The watercourse is characterised by several consecutive
   lakes and reservoirs. Vendace were first recorded in the upper part in
   1989, and had by 1995 invaded the whole 120 km long water system. In the
   upper part, vendace have become the dominant fish species in the pelagic
   zone, whereas whitefish Coregonus lavaretus have been relegated to the
   profundal and littoral zones. In the lower part, whitefish were by 1995
   still dominant in the pelagic habitat, but vendace constituted 30\% of
   the pelagic catches after being first recorded there in 1993. Vendace
   have established reproducing populations in the whole watercourse, with
   the 1990 and 1991 year-classes being particularly strong and important
   for the downward displacement. The new occurrence of vendace in the
   Pasvik River system probably represents the world's northernmost
   distribution of the species. The invasion appears to have a major
   ecological impact on the native communities, and represents a threat for
   both biodiversity conservation and the commercial fishery in the
   watercourse. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {107-117},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pre- and post-harvest population size and the structural composition of
   the moose Alces alces population in the Vefsn valley in northern Norway
   estimated by the use of cohort analysis were compared to population
   density indices derived from hunter moose observations during 1968-1993.
   The moose observation index (moose seen per hunter day) was able to
   predict the same trend in the post-harvest population size in 84\% of
   the cases, and was significantly linearly related both to pre- and
   post-harvest population size. The moose observation index was more
   closely related to the post- than to the pre-harvest population size,
   probably because the main part of the harvest took place during the
   first week of the hunting season, whereas the observation index was
   based on aggregated values collected over two weeks. Moreover, the
   observation index tended to overestimate population size when hunting
   success was high, indicating that factors influencing hunting success
   may also affect the probability of detecting moose. The recruitment rate
   (calves per female) recorded by the hunters was also closely related to
   the recruitment rate estimated by the cohort analysis, suggesting that
   the observed recruitment rate may provide a useful index of the
   recruitment to the population. We suggest that further improvements of
   moose recordings as a management tool can be obtained if the data are
   analysed separately for shorter periods (e.g. week, day) of the hunting
   season because this will probably reduce the impact of annual variation
   in harvesting rates on the estimates.},

Abstract = {The World Conservation Union (IUCN) defines populations as vulnerable if
   the probability of extinction is larger than 10\% within the next 100
   years. With the objective of minimizing problems with predation on
   domestic livestock and, at the same time, conserving a viable
   population, we consider different threshold harvesting strategies for a
   small population of brown bear, based on a population dynamics model
   with growth rate and demographic and environmental variances estimated
   from the present Swedish population. Taking into account uncertainties
   in present estimates of the demographic parameters and in population
   size, rye show that the population can be harvested when the population
   size exceeds 34 female bears aged one year and older, if the entire
   population exceeding the threshold is harvested. To minimize the
   expected long-term population size, however, we show that it is optimal
   to harvest only a proportion equal to 35\% of the population exceeding a
   lower threshold of 12 female bears. This strategy gives an expected
   long-term population size of around 20 female bears. If the growth rate
   of the population is reduced by ca. 3\%, the threshold muse, under some
   conditions, be doubled. We argue that the small thresholds are mainly a
   result of the high intrinsic growth rate of the population considered in
   the present paper. However, the analysis also suggests that IUCN's
   criterion might allow a rate of extinction that is too high.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {68},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {1, In order to compare spatial and temporal variation in the demography
   of a metapopulation of house sparrows living on four islands off the
   coast of Northern Norway, we computed the asymptotic population growth
   rate (lambda) for three transitions between years, using a projection
   matrix model.
   2, The mean growth rate of the metapopulation was positive (lambda =
   1.05).
   3. Large variation was found in space and time in the asymptotic growth
   rate. Even though the standard deviations of the estimates were large,
   lambda was significantly greater than 1 on one island in 2 out of 3
   years. In contrast, lambda significantly less than 1 occurred on an
   island on five occasions.
   4, Decomposition of the magnitude of the spatial and temporal components
   of lambda showed that one year (1995) had a particularly negative impact
   on lambda. In contrast, one island had a great positive effect.
   5, These differences in lambda were most closely related to variation in
   the juvenile survival rate and in the fecundity rate, which, in turn?
   was closely related to variation both in space and time in the
   proportion of the eggs that produced a fledgling.
   6, As expected from the large spatio-temporal variation in lambda, the
   sensitivities and the elasticities of lambda to variation in the
   different elements in the projection-matrix also differed both in space
   and time. When lambda was small, it was most influenced by variation in
   adult survival rate. In contrast, for large lambda, it was most
   sensitive to variation in the recruitment rate.
   7, We suggest that conditions during the breeding season determine
   whether a population acts as a source or sink in this temperate small
   passerine metapopulation, and that the ratio of juveniles to adults can
   be used to characterize populations as sources or sinks.
   8, These results demonstrate large variation in space and time in the
   demography of a small passerine metapopulation. These differences result
   from a combination of regional effects on the whole metapopulation, and
   factors that occur at one particular island in a single year.},

Pages = {620-632},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Subdivision of a population into reproductive units and rates of
   exchanges among them may influence population dynamics. Unfortunately,
   subpopulation units and flows of immigration and emigration are
   difficult to estimate because of the lack of data on spatial behavior of
   individuals. By studying two populations of chamois (Rupicapra), 244
   marked animals, and a 10-year monitoring program, we determined that
   subpopulation units were related closely to topographic limits in which
   >90\% of the females were philopatric. Males had a greater tendency to
   disperse than females, especially before reproduction, but females did
   more exploratory movements. We found no difference in sex-specific
   dispersal rates between sites, despite differences in densities and
   sex-ratio. The relatively high dispersal rate of males and the lack of
   effects of sex-ratio and density on dispersal rates support the
   inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis as a main cause of dispersal. High rates
   of exploratory movements, especially among females, indicates that local
   resource competition within female groups also may play a role.
   Dispersal patterns have to be explained in the context of possible
   different motivations between sexes, related to social and spatial
   segregation. Moreover, we argue for an effect of topography, which
   determines where dispersal is possible. Accordingly, dispersal occurred
   at a site with continuous connections with favorable habitat.
   Colonization of new areas from protected reserves is limited by low
   dispersal rates of females and increasing isolation between favorable
   areas in mountains. Management and conservation policies have to take
   these aspects into account to predict distribution of chamois on a large
   scale and cope with high local densities resulting from female
   philopatry.},

Abstract = {We examined the relationship between young brown trout ( Salmo trutta)
   density in lake tributaries, and water chemistry and habitat variables.
   The study was carried out during the autumn in three acidic, softwater
   river systems in western and southwestern Norway; Gaular and Vikedal
   (1987-1993) and Bjerkreim (1988-1993). The streams had mean calcium
   concentrations of 0.35 mg L-1 (Gaular), 0.52 mg L-1 (Vikedal) and 0.84
   mg L-1 (Bjerkreim). The concentration of inorganic Al was generally low,
   with mean values of 8.40 (Gaular), 22.22 (Vikedal) and 43.36 mu g L-1
   (Bjerkreim). In multiple regressions that involved different water
   chemistry variables, brown trout density correlated best with calcium
   concentration and with a combination of calcium and pH; the Ca2+:H+
   ratio. In Vikedal and Gaular, calcium explained 51 and 57\%,
   respectively, of the variability in brown trout densities. Althoug
   alkalinity exhibited the best correlation with brown trout density in
   Bjerkreim ( r(2)=0.33), it was similar to that of the model that
   included all major ions plus pH. The Ca2+:H+ ratio had a larger effect
   for variability in brown trout density in Gaular (r(2)=0.66) than
   calcium alone. In Vikedal and Bjerkreim, the Ca2+:H+ ratio also
   correlated with brown trout density, but considerably less than in
   Gaular. The predictive power of habitat variables was much lower than
   that of water chemistry; the single most important factors were altitude
   in Gaular (r(2)=0.22), mean water temperature in Vikedal (r(2)=0.11) and
   depth SD (index of heterogeneity) in Bjerkreim (r(2)=0.07). Models that
   included both habitat and water chemistry variables showed that the
   density of young brown trout was predicted primarily by calcium
   concentrations in Gaular (r(2)=0.75) and Vikedal (r(2)=0.54), as opposed
   to pH in Bjerkreim (r(2)=0.25). Habitat had low effect in all three
   river systems (r(2)=0.01-0.04). The final model explained 86, 68 and
   32\%, respectively, of the variability in brown trout density in the
   three catchments. Thus, water chemistry variables seem to be factors
   that limit the density of young brown trout in acidic softwater streams.},

Title = {Contradictory findings in studies of sex ratio variation in roe deer

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Patterns of sex ratio variation and maternal investment reported in the
   literature are often inconsistent. This could be due to intra- and
   inter-specific variation in social systems, but may also be a result of
   the a posteriori nature of much of this type of analysis or the testing
   of models which are inappropriate. Two recent papers reported directly
   opposed results concerning variation in offspring sex ratios in relation
   to maternal condition in roe deer, interpreting the results as support
   for the Trivers and Willard model and for the local resource competition
   hypothesis, respectively. In this paper, we present data on offspring
   sex ratios and early juvenile body weight from two long-term studies of
   this species to test predictions arising from these two models
   concerning sex biases in litter composition and maternal care. First, we
   observed no consistent pattern of sex differences in an index of weaning
   weight or body weight at 1 month old in either population, indicating a
   lack of sex bias in maternal care. However, in one population, higher
   maternal body weight was associated with higher juvenile body weight of
   daughters, but not of sons. Secondly, we found a negative, but not
   statistically significant, relationship between maternal body weight and
   litter sex ratio such that heavier females tended to produce more
   daughters and lighter females to produce more sons. These results
   indicate that roe females which have additional investment potential
   available do not invest it in sons, as predicted by the Trivers and
   Willard model. Our results map provide some support that roe deer are
   subject to local resource competition acting at the level of the
   individual mother; however, the fact that particular trends in sex ratio
   data can be explained in functional terms provides no indication that
   they are actually adaptive.},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {To determine general patterns of myrmecophagy in bears, we rested
   hypotheses regarding selection of ant species, factors important to
   bears when selecting ant species, factors influencing seasonal use of
   ants, and foraging behavior of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in central
   Sweden. Ants were an important food for these bears, constituting 12,
   16, and 4\% of fecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively.
   Ants were abundant, 30.5-38.5 tonnes per bear, and bears excavated
   8-33\% (mean 23\%) of the mounds of red forest ants annually. Carpenter
   ants (Camponotus herculeanus) were highly preferred. Among
   mound-building red forest ante, the Formica aquilonia/polyctena complex
   was preferred over Formica exsecta and Formica lugubris. The ants
   selected by bears had high digestible energy and low formic acid content
   and behaved passively when the colony was disturbed. Colony size and
   density may also have influenced the selection of ants. Seasonal use of
   ants was related not to the availability of pupae or the quality of
   plant foods but probably to the availability of other foods. Bears
   consumed only a small proportion of the ants, 4000-5000, each time they
   opened a mound, probably because of rapidly increasing difficulty in
   capturing them after the colony was attacked. Eurasian brown bears feed
   more on ants than North American bears do, perhaps because of greater
   availability of large colonies of red forest ants. Carpenter ants may
   have been especially available in our study area following intensive
   clear-cutting.},

Abstract = {Smolt migration through a shallow and turbid hydro-reservoir in a major

   Hatchery-reared 1+-year-old Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., smolts of
   equal size from two different non-native strains were radio-tagged and
   followed during their downstream migration through the 12-km-long
   reservoir. A total of 50 salmon smolts, 25 of Swedish (Atran River) and
   25 of Irish (Burrishoole River) origin, were surgically implanted with
   miniature radiotransmitters. The tagged smolts were tracked daily over a
   3-week period in May 1996. The Atran smolts initiated migration first (P
   < 0.001), moved faster (P < 0.01), were delayed less when passing a
   culvert (P < 0.001) and were more successful in moving through the
   reservoir than the Burrishoole smolts. The observed differences in
   migratory behaviour are interpreted as evidence of a genetic component
   influencing smolt migration.},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {The proportion of Atlantic salmon escaped from fish farms and caught in
   the Faroese salmon fishery was estimated using scale analysis. Samples
   were obtained of fish landed in the commercial fishery from 1980/1981 to
   1990/1991 fishing seasons and from research catches in the 1991/1992 to
   1995/1996 seasons. The material collected was in some years limited to
   only part of the fishing season. The estimated proportion of fanned
   salmon in the fishery was relatively low from 1980/1981 to 1986/1987,
   but increased considerably thereafter, and reached a peak in the
   1989/1990 fishing season when more than 40\% of the catch was estimated
   to be of farmed origin. Later, the proportion declined, and in recent
   seasons the proportions of Farmed salmon were estimated to be around
   20\%. These estimates were used to split the Faroese catch into wild and
   farmed components. It is concluded that if farmed components in salmon
   catches are not accounted for, catches of wild salmon will be
   overestimated and assessments of fisheries and stocks of wild salmon
   confounded. Furthermore, the increase observed in catch per unit of
   effort (c.p.u.e.) in the 1980s and early 1990s might have been caused by
   an increasing abundance of farmed salmon. (C) 1999 International Council

Abstract = {In this study we examined how the variation in the distribution of six
   species of seabird trematodes was influenced by human activities along
   the subarctic Barents Sea coast of northern Norway. This was done by
   comparing the prevalence of the parasites in two species of intermediate
   host (Littorina saxatilis and Littorina obtusata) on seashores near
   fishing industry complexes, fish farms and at control sites. In L.
   saxatilis there were higher prevalences at sites influenced by human
   activities for three out of five trematode species (Microphallus
   piriformes, M. similis, Cryptocotyle lingua) which have gulls (Larus
   spp.) as their predominant final hosts, while in L. obtusata, only M.
   similis was more common at sites with human activity. For M. pygmaeus, a
   trematode which has the common elder (Somateria mollissima) as its most
   predominant final host, the prevalence in L. saxatilis tended to be
   higher at sites with fishing industry, but differences were not
   significant. No such tendency was found in L. obtusata for this
   trematode. The overall prevalence in L. obtusata was lower than in L.
   saxatilis. This indicates that the vulnerability to trematode infection
   differs between the two snail species depending on the variation in the
   distribution patterns in the intertidal zone. Gulls tend to concentrate
   in areas near fishing industry and fish farms to feed on fish offal,
   which leads to an increase in the transmission between hosts, and to a
   higher level of parasite infection, locally.},

Abstract = {Transport of pollutants from industrial areas has resulted in Arctic
   environments facing increasing levels of organic pollution. Thus, a need
   for sensitive and reliable biomarkers that can be used to assess the
   risk associated with exposure to xenobiotics in these areas has arisen.
   In high latitudes, temporal variations in the nutritional status of
   animals can be considerable, and these variations may influence
   toxicokinetic processes and biomarker responses. In the present study,
   different biomarker (cytochrome P450 (CYP1A), pre- and post-stress
   plasma cortisol concentrations and fin erosion) responses were recorded
   in groups of PCB-exposed (given a single oral dosage of 1 mu g Aroclor
   1260 (g body weight)(-1)) and unexposed Arctic charr. Following
   treatment (PCB administration), fish were held for 141 days under either
   a restricted feeding regime or without food. PCB exposure did not effect
   either growth or organ lipid concentrations. Food deprivation resulted
   in a marked reduction in lipid concentration in muscle and kidney, and a
   3- and 11-fold increase in the PCB concentrations in the kidney and
   liver of the PCB-exposed fish. Food deprivation did not appear to
   influence hepatic EROD activities and CYP1A content, but the elevated
   PCB concentration in the liver of the fasted, PCB-exposed fish seemed to
   result in a dose-related increase in EROD activity and CYP1A content.
   Plasma cortisol concentrations of unstressed fish were below the
   detection limit of 3.6 ng ml(-1) Post-stress plasma cortisol
   concentrations were low in the food deprived fish, irrespective of PCB
   exposure. The highest post-stress plasma cortisol concentrations were
   recorded in PCB-exposed, fed fish. The fish that were held without food
   had the lowest incidence of fin erosion, whereas the combination of food
   deprivation and PCB exposure resulted in the highest prevalence of fin
   erosion. Thus, nutritional status (i.e. long term food deprivation)
   influenced both tissue concentrations of PCB, and biomarker responses.
   This must be borne in mind if biomarkers are to be used in environmental
   monitoring programmes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed for 48 h to water from
   acidified (pH 5.2) Fossbekk. River (Norway), with and without 94 mu g
   aluminium (Al)/L added as AlCl3, and to water from circumneutral (pH
   6.7) Ims River (Norway) (controls). Cardiac output, heart rate, and
   stroke volume were monitored throughout the exposure period with Doppler
   flow probes placed around the ventral aorta of the fish. Fish exposed to
   Fossbekk River water without added Al showed few physiological
   disturbances. When 94 mu g Al/L was added to Fossbekk River water, most
   of the fish died before the end of the 48-h exposure period, and a large
   elevation in heart rate was observed together with a decrease in plasma
   chloride concentrations and an increase in haematocrit, plasma glucose
   and plasma cortisol levels. Cardiac output was maintained at basal
   levels during the first 24 h of exposure because the tachycardia was
   accompanied by a concomitant reduction of stroke volume. Signs of
   arrhythmia appeared after 32 h of exposure and were associated with a
   further decrease in stroke volume that caused cardiac output to decrease
   below basal levels. The incapacity of the tachycardia to elevate cardiac
   output and the subsequent death of the fish suggest that this response
   to low pH and Al is more of a maladaptation reaction than a compensatory
   or adaptative reaction.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Telemetry studies of Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) fledglings (n = 53) were
   conducted from May to August in central Norway, where the species is at
   the northern limit of its range and its density is generally low.
   Mortality before dispersal was 61\% due to starvation and predation by
   red fox (Vulpes vulpes), pine marten (Martes martes), and Corvus spp.
   Mortality was highest during the first 10 days after leaving the nest
   box, when fledglings were small and had poorly developed locomotion.
   Fledglings that died or disappeared during the first 10 days after
   leaving the nest box were significantly lighter than those that
   survived. Mean distance between fledglings and nest box increased during
   the summer, but fledglings remained relatively close to siblings and
   their mother until dispersal. The average area used by fledglings that
   survived to dispersal was 26 ha (n = 15), which is a figure larger than
   reported elsewhere for this species. Dense forest habitats were
   preferred, and roosting sites offering good vertical and horizontal
   concealment were used frequently. We propose that observed habitat and
   area use reflect antipredator strategies and generally low density of
   this strictly territorial species.},

Abstract = {Understanding population dynamics of large mammals requires studies of
   variation in the age and sex-specific demographic parameters over time
   and the factors causing this variation. Here, we have focused on the
   Variation in body mass of 8-10-month old red deer calves, in relation to
   climate and sex over a 20-yr period (1977-1997). We investigated the
   relationship between body mass and over-winter mortality during 1985 and
   1986 and thereby, the phenotypic selection on body mass. We found a high
   variability from year to year in calf body mass. Males were consistently
   heavier than females. No interaction between sex and year was detected.
   The body mass of individuals from the same cohort shot during the annual
   hunting season and snow depth in January each explained ca 20\% of the
   variability in calf body mass. Body mass loss during winter did not
   differ between sexes, but increased with body mass and varied from year
   to year. The probability of surviving was strongly related to body mass
   in each sex. For a given body mass relative to the sex-specific mean,
   males had a lower probability of survival than females. Hence, males had
   to be 1 kg larger than their mean in order to achieve the same survival
   as average-sized females. Our results suggested a directional phenotypic
   selection on body mass that led to an increasing body mass dimorphism in
   calves. The strength of this selection and the sex difference in the
   shape of the selection curve may depend, however, on the severity of
   winter and on sexual dimorphism in body mass at the beginning of winter.},

   levels. After hatching, the hens were followed by radio telemetry and
   parental behaviour was recorded when the broods were flushed. Chick
   survival up to 8-9 days was recorded. Cd-contaminated hens showed less

Abstract = {Forty-one eggs of merlin (Falco columbarius) collected in Norway between
   1978 and 1994 were analyzed for persistent environmental pollutants. The
   mean levels of p,p'-DDE and PCBs were 9.4 (range 1.8-39.9) mu g/g and
   1.5 (range 0.25- 6.6) mu g/g fresh weight, respectively. HCB, HCHs,
   dieldrin and chlordanes all had mean levels of approximately 0.1 mu g/g,
   mercury 0.25 mu g/g, whereas mirex only had 0.005 mu g/g. Migration
   counts indicated that the Fennoscandian merlin population declined from
   the 1950's through the early 1960's, with a subsequent recovery from the
   1970's to the 1990's. Comparisons with eggs from museums showed that the
   shell thinning in all decades after 1947 was more than 10\%, exceeding
   15\% in the 1960's and 1970's. Persistent pollutants, especially DDE,
   probably affected population size. Eggshell thickness was significantly
   and negatively correlated with the DDE concentration in the egg.
   Pesticide levels were generally decreasing during the period covered by
   the study, and a parallel improvement in shell thickness was observed.
   Ringing recoveries indicated that different wintering areas were used by
   merlins from northern and southern Norway. This was a possible
   contributing factor for the observed regional variation in pollutant
   concentrations.},

Abstract = {Wild and non-native hatchery-reared brown trout, Salmo trutta L.,
   released when 2 summers old, were caught in the littoral habitat of
   Vinstervatna Reservoir, southern Norway. Hatchery-reared brown trout
   grew more slowly and had a smaller asymptotic length (293 +/- 71 mm CL)
   than native fish (391 +/- 56 mm CL). Hatchery-reared brown trout also
   exhibited significantly shorter life spans than native fish. This
   category consisted mainly of individuals aged 2+ and 3+ years, and only
   1.5\% of the specimens were aged greater than or equal to 5 years. The
   ages of the native fish in the sample were between 2 and 8 years, and
   the most abundant age groups of trout were 4+ and 5+ years. It is
   suggested that the differences in life-history characteristics are
   related to adaptations by the native trout to the local environmental
   conditions. In this reservoir, which has a limited food supply as a
   result of water level fluctuations and a high level of inter- and
   intraspecific competition, environmental effects might be significant.},

Title = {Cessation of the Norwegian drift net fishery: changes observed in

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of the ban on the
   Norwegian coastal drift net fishery in 1989 on the spawning run of
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations in four Norwegian and four
   Russian rivers. Catches/escapements, size distribution, sea-age
   proportions, and mean weights of different sea-age groups were collected
   from official catch statistics and analyses of scale samples. In three
   of the Norwegian rivers, catches of grilse (1SW) increased significantly
   after the ban on the drift net fishery. No changes were recorded for
   multi-sea-winter (MSW) fish. In addition, the proportion of grilse
   increased in all the Norwegian rivers, and 2SW salmon increased in three
   of them. The mean weight of grilse increased in all four Norwegian
   rivers, whereas the mean weight of 2SW fish decreased in the two rivers
   in southern Norway. The size of 3SW fish did not change. These changes
   correspond well to actual net selection curves and reported mean weight
   of drift net catches in different parts of Norway. Trends in the Russian
   populations were more varying. In the three rivers draining to the
   Barents Sea, changes were similar to those in the Norwegian rivers.
   However, these changes were less obvious than those observed in
   Norwegian populations. The authors conclude that the ban of the drift
   net fishery significantly affected the structure of the spawning run in
   Norwegian Atlantic salmon populations. Furthermore, the results indicate
   that the drift net fishery affected Russian salmon populations in rivers
   draining to the Barents Sea to a lesser extent than Norwegian salmon,
   and had no effect in rivers draining to the White Sea. (C) 1999

Abstract = {Seasonal changes in the species composition and fibre content of plant
   fragments in the rumen and the gross anatomy of the gastrointestinal
   tract were investigated in Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus
   platyrhynchus in western parts of Spitsbergen (Nordenskiold Land (NL),
   78 degrees N), where the tundra vegetation is relatively abundant, and
   on the island of Nordaustlandet ((NA) 81 degrees N) where, in the polar
   desert, plants are scarce. Reindeer were killed while grazing on NL in
   autumn (n = 19) and in winter (n = 10) and on NA in summer (n = 10) and
   in winter (n = 3). Rumen contents included mainly mosses and grasses in
   specimens from NL and mainly Saxifraga spp. in specimens from NA. The
   plant cell wall content of the dry organic matter in the rumen-reticulum
   (RR) ranged from 55\% to 77\% and from 43\% to 57\% in NL and NA
   specimens, respectively, and did not vary between seasons. In autumn,
   the wet weight of the contents of the RR ranged from 13\% to 20\% of
   body mass (BM) in females on NL and from 14\% to 24\% of BM in adult
   reindeer in winter. On NA, the wet weight of the contents of the RR in
   adult animals ranged from 15\% to 20\% of BM in summer and from 15\% to
   17\% of BM in winter in NA. The ratio of the wet weight of the contents
   of the distal fermentation chamber (DFC) to the wet weight of the
   contents of the RR was 1:8 in females in autumn, compared to 1:6-1:7 in
   adult animals on NL in winter. The ratio of the wet weight of the DFC to
   the wet weight of the RR ranged between 1:8-1:10 in summer, compared to
   1:7 and 1:8 in winter. There were no significant differences in the size
   of plant particles in the RR contents in females from the two areas in
   any season, indicating that ruminal plant particle size was not
   influenced by the concentration of plant cell walls in the rumen
   contents. We conclude that the degree of filling of the gastrointestinal
   tract of these reindeer was therefore principally a function of plant
   fibre chemistry. Svalbard reindeer are adaptable intermediate feeders
   but they have, nevertheless, developed a large DFC similar to that of
   concentrate selectors.},

Abstract = {In this study we present the first comprehensive multivariate analysis
   of beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest communities in the Nordic countries.
   The history of beech and beech forests in Scandinavia are described. In
   the north, the species is climatically restrained and, at present,
   restricted to Denmark and the southern parts of Sweden and Norway.
   More than 2000 sample plots were compiled, partly from literature,
   partly from new and unpublished data. The material included more than 20
   studies of beech forests, often recorded by different non-standardised
   sampling designs. Therefore, prior to data analysis, a large number of
   plots had to be excluded to reduce the heterogeneity of the data. Only
   such sample plots were considered that showed a predominance of Fagus
   sylvatica in the canopy, that had a size within the interval of 16-100
   m(2), and that could be located by geographical coordinates. All species
   abundance values were transformed into simple species presences, and
   data from different vegetation layers were merged into one.
   A TWINSPAN cluster analysis resulted in 15 types. Three main communities
   with several sub-communities and varieties can be distinguished: (1) the
   Fagus sylvatica-Fraxinus excelsior-Stachys sylvatica community on the
   most basic and fertile soils, (2) the Fagus sylvatica-Corylus
   avellana-Galium odoratum community on moderately fertile and acid soils,
   and (3) the Fagus sylvatica-Sorbus aucuparia-Deschampsia flexuosa
   community on very acid and oligotrophic soils. Synonyms in the recent
   literature on Nordic beech forests to these communities are given. An
   ordination with the program DECORANA confirmed the primary significance
   of soil acidity and nutrient status for community differentiation.},

Abstract = {The study aimed to compare plasma progesterone concentrations, rectal
   ultrasonography and plasma concentrations of pregnancy-specific protein
   B (PSPB) used for pregnancy diagnosis in reindeer. A total of 1595 blood
   plasma samples were collected between 1991 and 1996 from 3 semidomestic
   reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) herds on the Norwegian mainland
   (Mageroy, Soroy, Filefjell) and from 92 wild Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer
   tarandus platyrhynchus). Samples were collected between January and late
   April. plasma levels of progesterone and PSPB were measured and used as
   indicators of pregnancy. In addition, animals from the Filefjell herd
   and the Svalbard reindeer were investigated using transrectal
   ultrasound. The results showed that plasma progesterone lower than 7
   nmol 1(-1) rarely occurs in females diagnosed pregnant either by
   ultrasound or by observing a calf at foot 7 months after blood sampling.
   A very good agreement was found between plasma progesterone and PSPB
   when used for pregnancy diagnosis. On the Norwegian mainland, but not to
   the same extent on Svalbard, a high proportion of females with a high
   progesterone concentration was diagnosed not pregnant by ultrasound.
   This probably reflects a high rate of false negative diagnoses by the
   ultrasound method rather than false positives in the progesterone
   analysis.},

   Turdus iliacus?},
Journal = {ARDEA},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-111},
Abstract = {A significant proportion of Redwings Turdus iliacus reject non-mimetic
   model Cuckoo Cuculus canorus eggs experimentally introduced into their
   nests. However, very few cases of Cuckoo parasitism have been recorded
   for this species. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that egg
   rejection by Redwings has evolved as a defence against conspecific brood
   parasitism. There are strong indications that conspecific parasitism
   occurs among Redwings and a case of parasitism of a Redwing nest by the
   closely related Fieldfare Turdus pilaris is described. The Redwings'
   reactions against a foreign conspecific egg introduced into their nests
   were observed, and also those exhibited against a Fieldfare egg which
   resembles Redwing eggs. The rejection rate for foreign eggs was about
   20\%, which was statistically significantly higher than the value for
   another experimental group for which no egg manipulations were made but
   where the nest owners were exposed to a! stuffed Fieldfare dummy. The
   rate of Redwing aggression against a female conspecific dummy placed at
   the nest was higher than that recorded, in experiments in the same area,
   against a Cuckoo dummy placed at the nest. This reaction and the
   observed egg rejection behaviour support the hypothesis that Redwings
   have evolved a defence against conspecific brood parasitism.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Population size. calves per female, female mean age and adult sex
   ratio of a moose (Alces alces) population in Vefsn, northern Norway were
   reconstructed from 1967 to 1993 using cohort analysis and catch-at-age
   data from 96\% (6752) of all individuals harvested.
   2. The dynamics of the population were influenced mainly by
   density-dependent harvesting, stochastic variation in climate and
   intrinsic variation in the age-structure of the female segment of the
   population.
   3. A time delay in the assignment of hunting permits in relation to
   population size increased fluctuations in population size.
   4. Selective harvesting of calves and yearlings increased the mean age
   of adult females in the population, and, because fecundity in moose is
   strongly age-specific, the number of calves per female concordantly
   increased. However. after years with high recruitment, the adult mean
   age decreased as large cohorts entered the adult age-groups. This
   age-structure effect generated cycles in the rate of recruitment to the
   population and fluctuations introduced time-lags in the population
   dynamics.
   5. An inverse relationship between recruitment rate and population
   density, mediated by a density-dependent decrease in female body
   condition, could potentially have constituted a regulatory mechanism in
   the dynamics of the population, but this effect was counteracted by a
   density-dependent increase in the mean age of adult females.
   6. Stochastic variation in winter snow depth and summer temperature had
   delayed effects on recruitment rate and in turn population growth rate:
   apparently through effects on female body condition before conception.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon fry (0+) sampled from the River Alta exhibited only
   minor differences in stomach content weights and feeding rates
   throughout diel periods, hut feeding rates were generally lowest at
   night. In contrast, salmon parr (1+ to 3+) had large diel fluctuations
   in stomach content weight, with the largest weights usually being
   recorded during the night and early morning. Accordingly, their feeding
   rates were highest at night. This nocturnal feeding pattern was
   consistent throughout all sampling occasions, and appeared to reflect a
   persistent feeding periodicity in the salmon parr. The daily food
   consumption rates of both fry and parr were highest during midsummer and
   decreased towards autumn. (C) 1999 The Fisheries Society of the British

Abstract = {A critical assumption of radiotelemetry studies is that the

   the effects of marking techniques on survival of moose (Alces alces)
   calves from birth to the beginning of the autumn hunting season. We
   marked and followed 181 moose calves with ear tags and 71 with ear
   transmitters, and we also followed 175 unmarked control calves, all with
   marked mothers, in 5 study areas in Sweden; 2 areas had resident brown
   bears (Ursus arctos), and 3 did not. Survival was lower for calves with
   ear transmitters than for those with ear tags (P < 0.001) and for
   control calves (P < 0.001). There was no difference in survival between
   control calves and calves with ear tags (P = 0.09). Survival was lower
   in areas with bears, but bears apparently did not prey differentially on
   calves marked with ear transmitters. Marking newborn moose calves with
   plastic ear tags did not have measurable effects, but we do not
   recommend marking calves with ear transmitters, because of the high
   mortality rates calves experienced.},

Abstract = {The winter diet of 522 Common Murres (Uria aalge) killed in fishing nets
   off Ostfold, SE Norway was studied by analysis of stomach contents.
   Temporal variations throughout the winter 1989-1990 and sex and age
   specific differences in food choice were given special attention. A
   total of 1,864 food items were found in the 477 stomachs with contents.
   Otoliths and other fish remains constituted nearly 90\% of the items,
   while 10\% were remains of polychaete worms. Clupeids, gadids and gobids
   were the most common fish groups, both numerically and by frequency of
   occurrence. Although there were no sex and age specific differences in
   the frequencies of occurrence of the main prey groups, such differences
   were evident when data were expressed numerically Immatures took more
   clupeids, gobids and polychaetes but fewer gadids than did adults. Males
   took more clupeids, gadids and polychaetes than did females: females
   took more gobids than did males. The frequency of occurrence of
   clupeids, gadids and gobids in adults and immatures showed no
   significant variation during the winter. There was, however, a
   significant seasonal variation in the numerical occurrence of gadid
   items, but not of clupeid items, in stomachs from adults and juveniles
   during the three two-month periods in the winter 1989-1990. If this diet
   was representative, the total food consumption by Common Murres in
   Skagerrak during October 1989-March 1990 was about 12,520 metric tons,
   of which clupeids constituted 5,770 tons, gadids 6,435 tons. gobids 50
   tons, and polychaetes 63 tons. The consumption of both clupeids and
   gadids totalled approximately 10\% of the total landings by commercial
   fisheries in the North Sea and Skagerrak areas.},

Abstract = {Across the boreal forest of North America, lynx populations undergo
   10-year cycles. Analysis of 21 time series from 1821 to the present
   demonstrates that these fluctuations are generated by nonlinear
   processes with regulatory delays. Trophic interactions between lynx and
   hares cause delayed density-dependent regulation of lynx population
   growth. The nonlinearity, in contrast, appears to arise from phase
   dependencies in hunting success by lynx through the cycle. Using a
   combined approach of empirical, statistical, and mathematical modeling,
   we highlight how shifts in trophic interactions between the lynx and the
   hare generate the nonlinear process primarily by shifting functional
   response curves during the increase and the decrease phases.},

Title = {Family effects on growth and survival of juvenile roe deer},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {79},
Number = {8},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper reports evidence for family effects (i.e., nonindependence
   between siblings) on components of juvenile fitness in two
   high-performance populations of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). In Trois
   Fontaines (eastern France), 51 sets of twins were ear-tagged as newborns
   and then intensively monitored until adulthood (to greater than or equal
   to 4 yr of age). On the island of Storfosna (central western Norway), 79
   sets of twins and 40 sets of triplets were radiotracked from birth to
   greater than or equal to 1 mo of age. In both populations, family
   effects were observed for measures of early body development and winter
   body mass. Measurements for sibling fawns were more similar than the
   same measures for nonsiblings. During unfavorable years (i.e., poor deer
   survival in summer or high population density), sibling fawns survived
   or died together much more often than expected by chance. Conversely,
   during favorable years (i.e., high fawn survival or low density), there
   was no evidence for family effects on survival of either twins or
   triplets. These results demonstrate that family effects on juvenile
   fitness of roe deer are pervasive, and that family effects on early
   survival differ among years. To assess the consequences of family
   effects an population dynamics, we tested the model of J. F. Crow and N.
   E. Morton. This model proposes that family effects should cause
   increased variance in recruitment among females. Consistent with this
   model, Family effects led to a threefold increase in the variance of
   total reproductive success over 5 yr of 37 females in Trois Fontaines.
   Data from Storfosna (11 females monitored for 3 yr) also supported Crow
   and Morton's model. Ultimately, family effects in polytocous species
   could reduce the intensity of sexual selection and modify the genetic
   structure of populations.},

Abstract = {1. Ecotoxicological models used to assess the effects of radionuclides
   on freshwater ecosystems and the potential transfer to humans depend on
   accurate laboratory estimates of the elimination rate of radionuclides
   in fish.
   2. We determined experimentally the elimination rate (excretion) of
   caesium (Cs-134) of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (two populations),
   Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (two populations), whitefish Coregonus
   lavaretus and bream Abramis brama by single-dose caesium labelling and
   measures of subsequent samples of groups of fish maintained at different
   temperatures. Elimination rates between populations of the same species
   and among species were compared.
   3. Populations of the same species from similar thermal environments had
   similar elimination rates (Atlantic salmon) whereas those from different
   thermal environments differed significantly (Arctic charr).
   4. Caesium elimination rates varied among fish species. Bream had slower
   elimination rates than the other species at all temperatures, whereas
   Atlantic salmon had quicker elimination rates than the others at 16
   degrees C. The remaining differences among species were not consistent
   across temperatures, indicating differences in thermal performance.
   5. Approximately 45\% of the estimated elimination rates differed
   significantly from those predicted by a general caesium elimination
   model. We conclude that a single model for caesium elimination, valid
   for a wide range of species and populations, may be difficult to attain.},

Abstract = {Energy contents of immature parr and smelts, and mature resident and
   anadromous brown trout Salmo trutta sampled from a small stream in
   southern Norway were estimated from lipid, protein and carbohydrate
   concentrations. In immatures the lipid concentrations were highest in
   parr in the autumn. Mean lipid concentrations increased significantly
   with age in parr sampled in autumn (1.3\% in age 0+ to 3.4\% in age 3+),
   whereas they did not in smelts. The lipid concentrations of parr in
   spring were not significantly: different from those of similarly aged
   smelts. By contrast, the relative water content (\%) decreased with age
   in parr in the autumn and increased with age in smelts, mean values
   being slightly higher in smelts (78\%) than in parr (77\%). Protein and
   carbohydrate concentrations did not vary with age in the immature fish,
   mean protein concentrations being 18.0, 17.5 and 16.8\% in parr in the
   autumn and spring, and in smelts, respectively. In residents. the
   concentrations of lipids were Lower and of water higher, in age group 1
   than in older fish, whereas there was no significant variation with age
   amongst anadromous trout. The energy concentration of 2+ smelts (349 kJ
   100 g(-1)) was similar to that of 0+ parr in the utumn. Mean somatic
   energy density in autumn was 1.1 times higher in freshwater residents
   than in parr at age 1+ (407 and 387 kJ 100 g(-1)) and marginally
   different at age 2+ (462 and 426 kJ 100 g(-1), respectively). The energy
   contents per unit mass of residents were 1.3-1.6 times that of similar
   aged smelts. Mean somatic energy density of anadromous trout (504 kJ 100
   g(-1)) was higher than that of residents (455 kJ 100 g(-1)). Somatic

Abstract = {Based on data from radio-collared individuals, we present an analysis of
   the viability of two small populations of the Scandinavian brown bear,
   Ursus arctos. The northern and southern populations had different
   demographic characteristics, even though the population growth rate r
   and the demographic variance s(d)(2) were high in bath populations (r =
   0.13 and s(d)(2) = 0.180 in the north, and r = 0.15 and s(d)(2) = 0.155
   in the south). In the northern population the environmental variance
   s(e)(2) was not significantly different from 0, whereas in the south
   s(e)(2) = 0.003. In the south, this was related to high environmental
   stochasticity in the survival rate of the youngest animals, which
   resulted in an increase in survival with age in this population. In
   contrast, in the north, the probability of survival showed a slight
   decrease with age. Uncertainties were obtained from the joint
   distribution of bootstrap replications of r, s(d)(2) and s(e)(2).
   Although the uncertainty in these estimates is quite large; it is
   unlikely that even relatively small populations (> 10 females greater
   than or equal to 1 year old) will decline to size less than 1 after 100
   years. Analysis of the distribution of the critical population size
   (i.e. the population size where the population's logarithmic growth rate
   is zero) shows that these brown bear populations must be larger than 3-4
   females 1 year or older to secure a positive growth rate. Similarly, if
   we define a viable population as the population size where the chance of
   survival is greater than 90\% during a period of 100 years, 8 females
   greater than or equal to 1 year old must be present in the north and 6
   females in the south. This high viability of even small brown bear
   populations is due to high reproductive and survival rates. A relatively
   small increase in the mortality rate will strongly reduce the viability
   of even relatively large brown bear populations.},

   population growth rates of Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) from
   Finse, south Norway, using a threshold autoregressive (TAR) approach. We
   demonstrate that the population dynamics is both phase- and
   density-dependent. The phase-dependence accounts for the observed
   nonlinearity. We used the deduced stochastic model structure as a basis
   for evaluating the dynamic properties of this system. The dynamics is
   characterized either by limit cycles or chaos (the latter with a strong
   semi-periodic component). Stochasticity is seen to play an important
   role in the determination of the periodicity. The ecological
   implications of these statistical and mathematical results are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Seawater tolerance and development of the hormones thyroxine and
   cortisol were studied in hatchery-reared 2-year old sea trout (Salmo
   trutta L.) smelts: during the smolting period in 1995. The fish were
   reared under a simulated natural photoperiod and ambient water
   temperature. The fish were divided into two size groups. Fish from the
   small size group (mean 180 mm, range 143-210 mm) had an increasing
   seawater tolerance from the first sampling time, passing a plasma
   chloride value of 160 mmol l(-1) by the end of June. This group also
   showed a peak in plasma thyroxine and plasma cortisol concentrations by
   the middle of May and by the end of June, respectively. Sea trout from
   the large size group (mean 199 mm, range 172-228 mm) given the same
   light and temperature regimes as the small size group established their
   seawater tolerance about 2 weeks before the small size group. Also, the
   osmoregulatory capacity of fish from the large size group was better
   when compared to the small size group. It is concluded that fish size is
   important for the development of the hypoosmoregulatory capacity in sea
   trout. It is also shown that sea trout develop the same hormonal pattern
   (thyroxine and cortisol) as other salmonid species during the smelting
   period. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to analyse the recovery from
   loading and transport stress of hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smelts.
   The experiment was carried out during the regular transport of fish from
   Eidfjord to Bondhus river (4.5 h), from Lundamo to Surna river (2.5 h)
   and from Eikesdal to Eira river (0.5 h). Blood samples were obtained
   from the smelts before transport (control), 30 min after loading and 1,
   24 and 48 h after transport. Additionally, blood samples were obtained
   after a 24 h seawater challenge test before and after transport. Blood
   samples were analysed for haematocrit, plasma cortisol, lactate,
   glucose, chloride and sodium. Plasma cortisol concentrations increased
   up to 15 times from resting values, with a peak 1 h after transport. A
   severe discrepancy in both fresh- and seawater osmoregulatory ability
   was observed 24 and 48 h after transport. It is suspected that the low
   recapture rates and survival of the hatchery-reared salmon smelts were,
   in part, caused by the handling and transport of the smelts prior to the
   release. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Seawater tolerance and downstream migration were examined in 2-year old
   hatchery-reared brown trout, Salmo trutta L., and compared with wild
   downstream migrating trout in the spring 1994 and 1995, using a fish
   trap in the River Halselva, northern Norway. At release, seawater
   challenge tests (72 h, 34 parts per thousand) showed that about half of
   the variance in seawater tolerance of hatchery-reared fish was explained
   by fish size. On average, 34\% of the released trout migrated
   downstream, whereas 44-51\% had acceptable seawater tolerance at release
   (seawater challenge plasma chloride less than or equal to 160 mmol
   l(-1)). The migration tendency in hatchery-reared fish increased with
   increasing fish size at release. Migrating hatchery-reared fishes and
   first-time migrants of wild trout showed a well-developed
   hypoosmoregulatory capacity. Downstream migration in this brown trout
   stock therefore appears to be associated with a well-developed seawater

Abstract = {Empirical data and theoretical considerations indicate that species with
   high wing loading and low aspect run a high risk of colliding with power

   combination of heavy body and small wings restricts swift reactions to
   unexpected obstacles. When the number of reported collision victims is
   considered relative to the abundance and population size of the species
   concerned, some Galliformes, Gruiformes, Pelecaniformes and
   Ciconiiformes species seem to appear in disproportionately high numbers.
   In contrast, species frequently affected by electrocution particularly
   seems to involve Ciconiiformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes and
   Passeriformes. An alarmingly large number of species with endangered and
   vulnerable status are identified among the victims, but there are
   insufficient data at present for judging the significance of mortality

Abstract = {Populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway have increased
   continuously over the last decades. We tested the possible effects of
   climate and increase in population size on the survival rates and body
   condition of individuals in one of the northernmost populations of red
   deer in Europe. Based on 678 individuals of known age marked between
   1977 and 1995, we estimated annual survival rates, the probabilities of
   being harvested and the recapture probability according to sex, age,
   year, winter and spring weather, population size, and, body weight and
   body condition, using capture-mark-recapture models. Winter harshness
   negatively influenced the body weight of yearlings and the survival of
   calves of both sexes. Spring weather influenced the survival of males in
   all age classes. A negative trend during the study period was detected
   in body weight and condition of calves and yearlings, but not in any
   age- or sex- specific survival rates. No significant gender differences
   in mean survival were shown in any age class. Moreover, there was little
   (male) or no (female) detectable between-year variation in survival
   rates for yearlings and adults. Winter weather acts as a limiting factor
   on population growth through a short-term effect on first-year survival
   and a long-term effect on body weight. We discuss the surprising low sex
   differences in natural survival rates and the differential effects of
   winter harshness on body weight, body condition and survival in relation
   to life history characteristics of red deer.},

Title = {Regulation of food provisioning in the Antarctic petrel; the importance

Abstract = {1. Two hypotheses may explain how long-lived seabirds regulate the food
   provisioning to their chick. The fixed level of investment hypothesis
   states that the parents provide food for their chick according to an
   intrinsic rhythm, independent of their chick's need. The flexible
   investment hypothesis states that the parents adjust their food
   provisioning both according to their chick's and their own need.
   2. We tested how the Antarctic petrels adjust the food-provisioning
   according to their own body condition or to their chick's need. First,
   we selected parents in poor and good body condition. Then we gave all
   parents randomly a chick of different body mass, but of the same age. We
   then measured the chicks daily until they were fed for the first time
   after swapping.
   3. Parents in good body condition at hatching were more likely to
   produce a chick that was still alive 9 days after hatching than parents
   in poor body condition. Chick body mass at day 9 and at the end of the
   guarding period was positively related to the mean body condition of the
   parents at hatching.
   4. The meal size provided by parents in good body condition was larger
   than that provided by parents in poor body condition. Parents in good
   body condition delivered more food to small than to large chicks,
   whereas no such relationship was found among parents in poor body
   condition.
   5. Our results suggest that the Antarctic petrel parents adjust the
   amount of food delivered to their chick according to both the chick's
   need and their own body condition, and that the ability to respond to
   the chick's need is dependent upon their own body condition.},

Title = {The relative role of density-dependent and density-independent survival
   in the life cycle of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {751-762},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1.Density-dependent factors appeared important for the survival of
   juvenile Atlantic salmon in the River Imsa whilst density-independent
   factors were more important for the older fish at sea. In fresh water,
   density dependence was indicated by a stock-recruitment relationship
   with increasing loss-rates from eggs to smelts and from eggs to adults
   as egg density increased. 73\% of the loss-rates were explained by
   variation in egg density. At sea, density independence was indicated by
   the lack of a significant relationship between loss-rates and smelt
   densities.
   2. The relationship between smelt density and initial egg density was
   best described by an asymptotic `Cushing' type relationship with a
   plateau at densities higher than approximately 60 000 eggs for the total
   river areas of 10 000 m(2). The number of smelts developed from the eggs
   spawned varied between 350 and 2400.
   3. The relationship between smelt biomass in wet mass (kg 10 000 m(-2))
   or energy (kJ 10 000 m(-2)) and the amount of salmon eggs in the River
   Imsa increased asymptotically. Annual smelt biomass ranged from 13 to 88
   kg 10 000 m(-2), or 66 000 and 431 000 kJ 10 000 m(-2). Variation in egg
   density accounted for approximately 45\% of the variation in smelt
   biomass (mass or energy).
   4. Total wet mass and energy of adults (k:g 10 000 m(-2) and kJ 10 000
   m(-2)) produced in relation to the amount of eggs at the start of the
   year-class, were not significantly correlated, due to a high variation
   among years. The biomass of adults ranged from 73 kg 10 000 m(-2) to 655
   kg 10 000 m(-2) and in energy from 370 000 kJ 10 000 m(-2) to 3 270 000
   kJ 10 000 m(-2)
   5. Total adult biomass (adults caught at sea and in rivers) and the
   returning adults to the River Imsa in mass or energy were correlated
   with the size of the smelt cohort from which they originated. Yearly
   total adult biomass ranged between 240 and 3711 kg 10 000 m(-2), when
   the number of smelts ranged from 397 to 2751, respectively. The biomass
   of adults returning to the River Imsa was between 59 and 614 kg,
   produced from between 672 and 1621 smolts.},

Title = {Geographic expansion of an increasing brown bear population: evidence
   for presaturation dispersal},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {819-826},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. The distribution of brown bears (Ursus arctos L.) expanding into
   suitable habitat in Sweden following near extermination was estimated
   using harvest data from the period 1981-93. Core areas were defined as
   female concentration areas, where 90\% of the hunter-killed females were
   taken.
   2. Three predictions were tested, based on results of earlier bear
   dispersal studies, which show that females are extremely philopatric.
   Prediction 1: the relative density of females declines more rapidly from
   the centre of a core area towards the edge than for males. Prediction 2.
   males dominate in the peripheral areas, especially males in the age of
   most active dispersal (2-4 years of age). Prediction 3: females in the
   periphery are found closer to the edge of the core area than males.
   3. The results of the present study supported Predictions 1 and 2, but
   not Prediction 3. This indicates that males were more prone to disperse
   from the core areas than females. However, females that did disperse did
   not differ from males in distance from the core areas, and females were
   found up to 80-90 km from them. Such long-distance female dispersal has
   apparently not been previously documented in other bear populations that
   are stable or declining. The results strongly suggest that presaturation
   dispersal, i.e. dispersal occurring before the carrying capacity of the
   habitat has been reached, is occurring in this increasing population.
   This phenomenon might be more common in increasing populations of large
   mammals than was previously thought. Regarding conservation of bears,
   this result is positive for gene flow and metapopulation dynamics and
   negative for livestock losses in formerly bear-free areas.
   4. Core and peripheral areas can be identified based on the age and sex
   of shot bears. This allowed us to classify Norway as a peripheral area.
   Bear density appears difficult to estimate near an expansion front
   because of large differences in densities over short distances.},

Volume = {29},

Pages = {241-247},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We studied how variation in different reproductive traits (hatching
   date, clutch number and clutch size) in addition to mass, size and
   condition of the fledgling influenced its probability of survival until
   recruitment in a House Sparrow population living on islands off the
   coast of northern Norway in 1993 and 1994. Twenty-three and 21\% of the
   fledglings were recorded alive in the population the year after
   hatching, respectively. Most mortality occurred just after fledging. In
   both years larger-sized fledglings survived better than smaller ones.
   Juvenile survival was independent of clutch size. Multiple logistic
   regression analyses showed that in both years juvenile survival
   increased with body size (expressed as tarsus length). In addition, in
   1993 fledglings in high body condition survived better, whereas in 1994
   hatching day explained a significant proportion of the variation in
   juvenile survival. However, this last year both body condition and size
   increased significantly with hatching date, suggesting that juvenile
   survival rate may have been dependent on body condition also in this
   year. These results demonstrate that losses of juveniles during the
   non-breeding season are strongly influenced by factors during the
   breeding season that affect the size and condition of the fledglings.},

Title = {Body mass and parental decisions in the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica
   antarctica: how long should the parents guard the chick?},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {73-79},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Procellariiformes, the parents guard the chick after it has attained
   homeothermy. This strategy may reduce the probability that a small chick
   is taken by predators, but is costly as only one parent can forage at a
   time. The decision to leave the chick may therefore be a compromise
   between the chick's vulnerability to predators, the body condition of
   the parent on the nest and whether the foraging parent returns in time.
   We studied how the number of days that parents guarded the chick was
   related to the body mass of the parent at the nest and the time the
   foraging parent spent at sea in the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica
   antarctica. We also examined how the body mass of the parent on the nest
   and the duration of the foraging trips influenced the chicks' body
   condition at the end of the guarding period. When the foraging parent
   did not return to the nest in time to relieve its mate, the number of
   days the parent on the nest kept guarding the chick was positively
   related to its body mass on arrival in the colony. The number of days
   the foraging parent spent at sea was positively related to the body mass
   of its mate, but those that returned in time had a shorter stay at sea
   relative to their mate's body mass than those that did not return before
   their mate had left. Apparently, both the body mass of the parent at the
   nest and the ability of the foraging parent to adjust its stay at sea to
   the mate's body mass is important for the number of days the parents
   guard the chick and also the chick's body condition at this point. The
   inability to return to the nest before the mate has left may be the
   result of needing a minimum amount of time at sea to find food, or
   because some parents having low foraging success and therefore prolong
   their stay at sea.},

Abstract = {The mortality of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) fawns in summer was
   studied on Storfosna Island (10 km(2)), a predator-free island 2 km off
   the west-central coast of Norway, during a period of rapid population
   increase. Between 1991 and 1994 the population density increased from
   about 10 to 40 roe deer/km(2). During this period 285 live and 36
   stillborn fawns were found and the live fawns were all subsequently
   radio-collared. All observed mortality occurred within the first 35 days
   of life. The main causes of death were stillbirth,
   starvation/hypothermia, drowning, car accidents, and falls. The average
   annual total mortality for all 4 years was 18\%. Although there was a
   large increase in mortality between 1991 and 1992 (from 10 to 18\%),
   there was little subsequent increase in the last 3 years, resulting in
   an overall weak density dependence in total mortality. However, the
   proportion of stillbirths (5\% in 1991 to 15\% in 1994) showed a clear
   and significant trend toward an increase with increasing density. Low
   temperatures in April, which strongly affect the timing of the spring
   flush of high-quality forage during late gestation, also tended to
   contribute to higher mortality. Fawns that died were found to have
   reduced individual growth rates prior to death compared with fawns that
   survived. Fawns born to relatively light mothers or in triplet litters
   had higher mortality rates than those born to heavy mothers or in
   smaller litters. Maternal age and date of birth or sex of fawn had no
   effect on mortality.},

Abstract = {Life history theory suggests that animals should balance their current
   investment in young against their chances to reproduce in the future.
   One fundamental prediction from the theory is that long-lived species
   should be restrictive in any increase of their current investment. It
   has been suggested that long-lived species, therefore, have evolved a
   fixed level of investment in young in order to maximize their own adult
   survival. However, recent experimental studies have shown that
   long-lived seabirds have a flexible reproductive performance and adjust
   their effort in raising young, both according to their own body
   condition and to the need of the chicks. In this study, we present a
   model of the optimal balance between reproductive effort and adult
   survival for long-lived birds breeding in a stochastic environment.
   During poor breeding conditions, maximum fitness is achieved either by
   not breeding at all, or by abandoning the brood. Beyond a certain
   threshold in breeding conditions, there is a steep increase in
   reproductive effort and an equally steep decrease in adult survival. The
   model is applied to two hypothetical long-lived seabirds differing in
   their potential fecundity. For the genotype with a potentially high
   fecundity, the model predicts a high threshold for breeding (i.e.,
   breeding conditions need to be very good for the species to attempt
   breeding); above the threshold, the value of reproduction in terms of
   fitness is high. For the genotype with potentially low fecundity, the
   model predicts a low threshold for breeding, and the value of
   reproduction in terms of fitness is low. By increasing clutch size in
   the model, we examine the optimal response of the two genotypes to an
   experimental brood size manipulation. For both genotypes, the model
   predicts that the threshold for breeding is lower among controls than
   among enlarged broods, giving a range of possible outcomes of the
   experiment depending on breeding conditions. The few studies on brood
   enlargements in long-lived species carried out so far may support the
   predictions from the model.},

   dosages of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) at low temperatures. Maximum induction
   was reached at day 5 in both organs, with highest values in the liver.
   No clear dose-response could be observed, possible due to an extremely,
   sensitive P450 system or a limited B(a)P absorption front the gut. The
   apparent sensitivity of both organs towards B(a)P exposure can be
   considered as advantageous for biomonitoring. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Mercury concentrations in vegetation, insects and insectivorous birds
   were studied in the vicinity of a mercury production plant at Rudnany,
   Slovakia and a zinc smelter at Odda, Norway. Comparison was made with
   pristine reference sites in both countries. Sampling of eggs and
   juvenile birds was facilitated through the use of nest boxes. In Norway
   the migrating species Ficedula hypoleuca was studied, whereas in
   Slovakia both migrating and resident birds were represented. While the
   Hg levels in vegetation and insects corresponded well to the
   expectations based on previous knowledge of contamination levels, the
   levels in passerine bird eggs seemed to depend mainly on whether the
   bird was migratory or resident. In chicks liver Hg levels at different
   sites in Norway showed no clear correspondence with egg levels at the
   same sites. At the background site an initial Hg burden provided through
   the egg was rapidly reduced, probably through excretion during feather
   development, whereas at the most contaminated site intake of Hg through
   contaminated food outweighed the excretion effect. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {The young of brown bears Ursus arctos Linneaus, 1758 are sometimes

   these young survive by taking them into captivity. We report on the fate
   of five young-of-the-year brown bears in two litters that lost their
   mothers in May and September. We left food for one of the two cubs that
   were abandoned in May after the other one had died. He was shot four
   years later and had a normal weight at that time. The other three lost
   their mother in September, probably to illegal hunting. One was lighter
   than normal the following May and died that year. The two others are
   still alive at almost six years of age, and have shown normal growth and
   reproduction. We conclude that young-of-the-year brown bear cubs in
   Scandinavia can survive well on their own from the beginning of July,
   and recommend that they be left where they are found.},

Abstract = {The migratory behaviour of adult wild and escaped farmed Atlantic
   salmon, Salmo salmo L., before, during after spawning in the River
   Namsen, Norway, was analysed using radio telemetry. The fish were
   caught, radio tagged and released into the fjord between 7 and 25 km
   from the river mouth. A significantly higher proportion of wild (74\%)
   than farmed (43\%) salmon was subsequently recorded in the river. Wild
   salmon (33\%) were more frequently captured in the sea and in rivers
   than farmed salmon (14\%). The migration speed from release to passing a
   data logger 11 km upstream from the river mouth was not significantly
   different between wild (20.6 km day(-1)) and farmed (19.8 km day(-1))
   salmon. Wild salmon tagged when water now in the river was increasing
   had a significantly higher migration speed than wild salmon tagged when
   water now was decreasing. This was not true for farmed salmon. Farmed
   salmon were distributed significantly higher up the river than wild
   salmon during spawning, although both types of fish were found together
   in spawning areas. Thus, there was no geographical isolation to prevent
   spawning between wild and escaped farmed salmon. Farmed salmon had
   significantly more and longer up- and downstream movements than wild
   salmon during the spawning period. Unlike farmed salmon, the number of
   riverine movements by wild salmon increased significantly when variation
   in water now increased. A smaller proportion of wild (9\%) than farmed
   (77\%) salmon survived through the winter after spawning.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to test whether the pattern and dynamics
   of occurrence of Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia) in a fine-grained
   landscape mosaic could be predicted from the results of a study in a
   more intensively managed course-grained landscape with much less
   suitable habitat and a different matrix. Twenty-one years of regular
   inventories of Hazel Grouse during spring, summer, and autumn and a
   vegetation map of suitable Hazel Grouse habitat were used to analyze the
   extinction an d(re)colonization of Hazel Grouse in different patches in
   relation to the size and isolation of the patch and the vegetation
   surrounding it. As predicted, patch area was the most important variable
   determining Hazel Grouse occupancy, (re)colonization, and local
   extinction. Also as predicted, the proportion of open habitat
   surrounding the habitat (i.e., and isolation effect) was also important.
   The isolation effect occurred at a smaller scale in the fine-grained
   habitat than the intensively managed landscape. This was apparently
   related to the type of matrix open land in the fine-grained landscape
   and unsuitable, but forested, habitat in the coarse-grained landscape.
   The Hazel Grouse appears to be usually sensitive to habitat
   fragmentation, but the mechanism causing the isolation effect differed
   between landscapes, probably because of the amount of suitable habitat
   left and the type of matrix in the landscape.},

Abstract = {The diet of the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica was studied
   during two seasons at Svarthamaren, an inland colony in Dronning Maud
   Land, Antarctica, and in the pack ice off the coast of Svarthamaren. The
   most important food (wet mass) at Svarthamaren was crustaceans (67\%),
   fish (29\%) and squid (5\%); however, individuals collected in the pack
   ice took mostly fish (87\%). The prey composition and lengths of prey
   are comparable to what has been documented in other studies on this
   species. Estimates of food consumption by birds breeding at Svarthamaren
   (ca. 250,000 pairs) suggest that approximately 6500 tonnes of
   crustaceans, 2800 tonnes of fish and 435 tonnes of squid are consumed
   during the breeding season. The annual consumptions of these birds are
   estimated to be 34,100 tonnes of crustaceans, 14,700 tonnes of fish, and
   2300 tonnes of squid. Satellite telemetry data indicate that Antarctic
   petrels from Svarthamaren may fly more than 3000 km during one foraging
   trip, and thus may cover a huge ocean area to obtain their prey.},

Abstract = {Current challenges for the study of population ecology of microtine
   rodents are reviewed. Comparisons with other taxonomic groups (other
   mammals, birds and insects) are given throughout. A major challenge is
   to link patterns and processes (i.e. mechanisms) better than is the case
   today. Other major challenges include the furthering of our
   understanding of the interaction between deterministic and stochastic
   processes, and as part thereof, the interaction between
   density-dependent and density-independent processes. The applicability
   of comparative studies on populations exhibiting different temporal
   dynamical patterns is, in this connection, emphasized. Understanding
   spatiotemporal dynamical patterns is another major challenge, not the
   least from a methodological point of view. Long-term and large-scale
   ecological data on population dynamics (in space and time) are critical
   for this purpose. Looking for consistency between hypothesized
   mechanisms and observed patterns is emphasized as a good platform for
   further empirical and theoretical work. The intellectual feedback
   process between different approaches to the study of microtine
   population ecology (observational studies, experimental manipulative
   studies, statistical modeling and mathematical modeling) are discussed.
   We recommend a pluralistic approach (involving both observational and
   experimental as well as theoretical studies) to the study of small
   rodent ecology.},

Abstract = {Until recently, most studies on microtines have focused on patterns in
   population dynamics or demography without providing a quantitative
   assessment of the robustness of the inferred patterns as well as a link
   between demography and population dynamics. Developments in statistical
   time-series analysis on the one hand and in capture-recapture
   statistical modelling on the other hand, now allow for improved
   analyses. We review some of the recent developments in the
   capture-recapture statistical methodology - restricting ourselves to
   methods most relevant to the demography of small mammals. A 5-years
   study of the gray-sided vole Clethrionomys rufocanus in Hokkaido, Japan
   was used as an example to explore some models. We then provided a
   framework for further demographic analysis of microtine populations,
   including C. rufocanus. Investigating the relative importance of the
   different demographic parameters (e.g. survival, maturation, dispersal)
   will require studies done on larger scale than is commonly done today,
   with more effort devoted to the low density phase. Special emphasis is
   given to study-design, and to experimental designs tailored to the study
   of specific demographic mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Our globe consists of a mosaic of crustal plates, which move in
   different directions. The direct connection from the mantel through
   fissures of the crust reveal interesting ecological processes. In two
   places, the rifting apart of crustal plates is of particular interest
   for limnology: in Iceland on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and within the Rift
   Valley systems of East Africa, In Africa, the geological process has
   been in progress above sea level for millions of years, but in Iceland
   for only thousands. Recent studies have linked nature to history. This
   paper discusses resource polymorphism in Arctic charr in Thingvallavatn,
   in relation to the role of habitat formation. Thingvallavatn is the only
   known lake in the world with four Arctic charr morphs utilizing the
   different food resources of the lake. Among the morphs, a clear
   differentiation in life history characters, morphology, habitat, and
   food ecology, has occurred within 10 000 years. The morphs also
   demonstrate a partial genetic differentiation, suggesting a separation
   into three reproductively semi-isolated gene pools. Conservation and
   management of this unique lake ecosystem and its catchment area are in
   progress.},

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {487-502},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Several bivariate probability distributions, generated by different
   underlying dispersal mechanisms, are fitted to the observed frequencies
   of an isozyme marker gene using a maximum likelihood approach. The
   pollen dispersal data were generated using two experimental populations
   of meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), homozygous for different
   allozymes at the (Pgi-2) locus, arranged in a circular donor-acceptor
   field design. The contribution of a plant depends on plant position,
   fecundity and flowering time, factors which are taken into account when
   fitting the different models. Several approximate likelihood-ratio tests
   are done between alternative nested models, and a wind threshold model
   with bimodality in the wind direction is selected. The evolutionarily
   important variances and expectations of gene displacement under the
   selected model are calculated. It is also shown that the underlying
   probability distribution is significantly more than exponentially
   leptokurtic. By fitting a distribution of deposition in all three
   dimensions to the data, taking into account differences in plant height,
   separate estimates of additional physical parameters are obtained,
   showing that gravity and vertical random movements are more important
   than intervening vegetation in limiting pollen dispersal in meadow
   fescue. According to the model, plants with a high seed yield contribute
   pollen over-proportionally to neighbouring plants.},

Title = {Lipid dynamics in anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.):

Journal = {FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {18},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changes in lipid class composition of tissues of anadromous Arctic
   charr, Salvelinus alpinus, were studied in relation to seasonal patterns
   of lipid deposition and lipid mobilisation. Charr of a north Norwegian
   population were collected in late May when fish were migrating towards
   the sea, and in mid-July when the fish re-entered fresh water. Some
   maturing fish captured in mid-July were held in captivity until late
   September to assess lipid dynamics associated with maturation. The
   carcass (head, fins, skeleton and skin) accounted for approx. 50\% of
   the total body lipid content when the fish re-entered fresh water from
   the sea. Triacylglycerols (TAG) comprised 75-80\% of the carcass lipid
   in ascending charr, confirming that the carcass is a major lipid depot.
   The skeletal muscle also represented a major lipid store: muscle of
   ascending charr contained 35-40\% of the body lipids, with TAG being
   dominant (approx. 75\% of muscle lipid). The gut (gastrointestinal tract
   and visceral lipid) and liver of ascending charr each held only 4-5\% of
   the body lipid, TAG being the dominant lipid class in both of these
   depots (Gut TAG: 60-65\%; Liver TAG: 50-55\%). Body lipid decreased
   30-40\% during maturation: lipids were depleted from all depots, but
   mobilisation of TAG from the carcass and muscle was quantitatively the
   most important. In mature females, the ovaries held almost 25\% of the
   body lipid, with the proportion of TAG exceeding that of polar lipids
   (PL)(TAG: 62\%; PL 12.4\%). In the mature males, the testes accounted
   for less than 3\% of the total lipids. TAG tended to dominate the testis
   lipids (TAG: 29.5\%), but there were also quite high proportions of free
   fatty acids, cholesterol and polar lipids (FFA: 23.5\%; C: 15\%; PL
   9.7\%). Females lost approx. 80\% of their body lipid during spawning
   and overwintering, the majority of this being TAG. Males also lost large
   amounts of TAG during the winter, but in contrast to the females lipid
   depletion amounted to only 50-55\% of that present at the time of ascent
   into fresh water.},

Year = {1998},
Volume = {82},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Microtine body weights vary temporally and geographically: they are low
   before the onset of winter and are highest in northern cyclic
   populations, particularly at peak densities, as well as in island
   populations. Adaptive explanations have focused on the relationships
   between body weight, age-specific reproductive and survival rates as
   well as on population dynamics. We live-trapped five populations of bank
   voles for up to five years in the French Alps in subalpine habitats: two
   spruce forests, a deciduous forest, a hedgerow network, and a boulder
   field recolonized by birch and spruce. Population dynamics were
   non-cyclic, characterized by seasonal fluctuations. Densities were
   generally high, with little variability among years. Survival rates were
   higher (0.80 to 0.90 per month), both during summer and winter, than
   reported from other populations of bank voles in Europe, or of
   microtines in general. Survival rates varied little among years, despite
   large Variation in snow depth and duration of snow cover, and were
   similar between males and females. Sex ratio was generally biased
   towards males (average proportion of males: 0.59).
   Body weights were higher than for lowland or northern European
   populations, both for adults in the spring and for subadults at the
   onset of winter. The latter difference was particularly large, autumn
   body weights being 50\% higher than in these other populations.
   Difference between autumn and spring weights was therefore much reduced
   compared with northern populations. Moreover, sexual dimorphism was the
   inverse of what is known for other populations in which males are
   smaller than females, males being larger than females during the
   breeding season in all populations studied here. We suggest that the
   overall larger body weight is a consequence of a higher survival rate
   selecting for lower reproductive effort and a higher somatic allocation,
   and that the reversed sexual dimorphism is a consequence of more intense
   sexual selection among males, deriving from a larger body size, and
   possibly also from a male-biased se?: ratio. We discuss the importance
   of food, habitat heterogeneity and predation in shaping life histories
   and population dynamics of microtines. Lower impact of predation,
   possibly resulting from the absence or scarcity of weasels, is one
   possible cause for the observed higher survival rates, and consequently
   larger body size of the alpine bank vole.},

Abstract = {Since staging and wintering sites of the globally threatened lesser

   transmitters were used to map autumn and winter migration routes of four
   individuals. After having spent c. 2 weeks at a post-moulting staging
   place in Finnmark, north Norway, ail individuals flew directly to the
   Kanin Peninsula, northwest Russia. Later, two of the geese migrated
   along a westerly route to East Germany, where one of the geese
   disappeared, and to Hungary and Greece. The other two individuals
   followed an easterly route. One was shot close to the west side of the
   Ural mountains, whereas the other individual disappeared in the Ob
   valley, Russia. The results might indicate a higher hunting pressure
   along the eastern route than along the western route. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {The behaviour of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos and Sea Eagles
   Haliaeetus albicilla scavenging on artificially laid out carcasses in
   coastal Sor-Trondelag Province, Norway, was studied during two winters
   (totalling 640 h of observations) and the intervening summer (430 h),
   Neither species fed at carcasses in summer, Although smaller, Golden
   Eagles were strongly dominant over Sea Eagles in direct competition for
   carcass access, In Sea Eagles, females dominated males, while in Golden
   Eagles, few conflicts between birds of known sex were observed, Age
   effects were weak and not statistically significant in both species.
   Conflicts for carcass access tended to be most escalated between Golden
   Eagles and least escalated between Sea Eagles, with interspecific
   conflicts intermediate, Most conflicts were won by the aggressor,
   suggesting that birds were generally able to assess relative dominance
   before launching an attack, Young eagles fed longer at a carcass than
   older individuals in both species, suggesting that young eagles may have
   been hungrier or less efficient feeders, Sea Eagles waited longer than
   Golden Eagles between arrival in the immediate carcass area and feeding
   at the carcass, This effect was greater when the carcass was already
   occupied but also occurred when no other eagle was already present,
   While interspecific competition for carrion did not appear to have
   important consequences for the two species in coastal Norway, in western
   Scotland, where Sea Eagles are currently re-establishing, carrion is
   important in the diet of both species all year round, Interspecific
   competition for this resource may therefore play a role in determining
   the ultimate realized niche (and therefore numbers) of the two species
   in Scotland in the longer term.},

Abstract = {Timing of birth was determined for 292 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
   fawns belonging to 146 litters on an island in central Norway between
   1991 and 1994, and for 33 fawns belonging to 19 litters from an inland
   site from 1995 to 1997. On the island site there was no significant
   variation between years in the mean date of birth, 22 May, nor was there
   any significant effect of dam age, fawn sex, or litter size. Individual
   does tended to give birth close to the same date in consecutive years.
   Mean birth date at the inland site was 5 June. The births showed a
   relatively high degree of synchrony with 80\% occurring within 26 days
   and 24 days at the island and inland sites, respectively. Copulation
   dates were much more synchronized than birth dates on the island site.
   Gestation length averaged 301 days, although individuals varied by up to
   26 days. When comparing published data from European populations, there
   appears to be extensive variation in timing of birth, while birth
   synchrony is very conservative. There appears to be little possible
   anti-predator benefit for roe deer in any pattern of birth synchrony.
   Because of their high post-natal investment and large litter size, we
   hypothesize that roe deer are constrained to give birth close to the
   peak of forage productivity.},

Abstract = {We present data on fidelity to territory, and length of tenure
   (multi-year) for bucks of European roe deer Capreolus capreolus
   (Linnaeus, 1758) based on 26 radio-collared individuals that were
   followed for up to 5 years. Individual bucks showed a high degree of
   fidelity to summer territory, with consecutive year's activity centres
   being less than 200 m apart on average. An average 70\% of one year's
   territory was within the borders of the previous year's territory. No
   buck occupied a territory which did not overlap with the previous year's
   territory. Activity centres of consecutive winter home ranges were on
   average 502 m apart, although this difference was not significant.
   Several cases of switching between non-overlapping winter ranges between
   years were observed. Annual survival was high (97\%) and we observed
   only a single case of an old buck losing dominance on his former
   territory after a very hard winter. All other surviving bucks regained
   their dominance on their territories. It is suggested that the roe deer
   bucks were demonstrating an ``always stay{''} strategy in order to gain
   the benefits of site familiarity. This is in keeping with the concept of
   roe deer territoriality being a relatively ``low-risk low-gain{''}
   strategy where emphasis is placed on survival and multi-year tenure of a
   territory.},

Abstract = {We compared the use of space and habitat by wolverines, Gulo gulo, and
   arctic foxes, Alopex lagopus, on the Snohetta plateau and surrounding
   mountains in south-central Norway. The arctic foxes used smaller annual
   home ranges than the wolverines, whose home ranges were among the
   largest yet reported for the species. In both species, resident males
   used larger home ranges than resident females. Arctic foxes used a much
   narrower, and higher, range of altitudes than wolverines, always above
   the tree line. Wolverines used lower altitudes in winter than in summer.
   Female wolverines showed pronounced seasonal peaks in their use of the
   peripheral areas of their home ranges. Both species showed an ability to
   cross at least some transportation corridors (road, rail, human
   settlements) in the area. The habitat available at Snohetta appears
   suitable for arctic foxes and does not explain the failure of the
   population to recover during 67 years of protection. Because of
   predation on domestic sheep, wolverines will probably be confined to a
   series of core conservation areas (CCA). At present densities (0.28-0.36
   wolverines per 100 km(2)), the CCA surrounding Snohetta can contain from
   36 to 50 wolverines.},

Abstract = {Age determinations of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) were compared
   in two different tests. In the first test, the readers determined the
   age of each individual from one calcified structure (scale, otolith, or
   opercular bone) at a time. The samples from three populations, 50
   specimens in each, were mixed so that the readers did not know which
   population each calcified structure was from. A sample of known-age
   whitefish was used in the second age determination test, where
   information such as time of catch, length, weight, and sex was available
   to the readers. In each of the 50 envelopes the reader got scale
   impressions and two otoliths, one of which had been burned and ground.
   In the first test, the precision of the readers was low both between
   readers and between different structures. In the samples of slow-growing
   populations, the determinations made from the otoliths showed older ages
   than the determinations from the scales. In the second age determination
   test the results were better; 73-90\% (average 82\%) of the
   determinations were correct. The use of two calcified structures and the
   knowledge of the material were considered to improve the accuracy. Age
   determination bias may occur that affects the age distribution: even
   though 80\% of the fish were aged correctly, an exceptionally strong or
   weak year class could remain unidentified. The estimation of growth rate
   seemed less sensitive to incorrect age determination than age
   distribution.},

Abstract = {The survival of two Atlantic salmon stocks that inhabit rivers confluent
   with the North Sea was examined in respect to historical distributions
   of sea surface water temperatures. The rivers Figgjo and North Esk are
   relatively small salmon rivers in southern Norway and eastern Scotland,
   respectively. Wild salmon smelts have been tagged in these rivers since
   1965. Tag returns were used to evaluate the survival of salmon in the
   North Sea. Survival rates of one-sea-winter (1SW) and 2SW fish were
   correlated within stocks, as well as between stocks, Survival rates were
   compared with the areal extent of thermal habitat in the north-eastern
   Atlantic Ocean. A positive correlation was found between the area of
   8-10 degrees C water in May and the survival of salmon. A reciprocal
   negative correlation was also found between survival and 5-7 degrees C
   water in the same month. An analysis of sea surface temperature
   distributions for periods of good vs. poor salmon survival showed that
   when cool surface waters dominate the Norwegian coast and North Sea
   during May, salmon survival has been poor. Conversely, when the 8
   degrees C isotherm has extended northward along the Norwegian coast
   during May, survival has been good. The effect of water temperature
   distributions on the growth of postsmolts and other survival factors are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine the influence of geographical and land-use
   factors on breeding bird species richness in small woods within
   farmland. In many European agricultural landscapes, small woods
   represent the major component of semi-natural habitat available to
   wildlife. We used census data (for woods of up to 15 ha) from six study
   areas in four countries (The Netherlands, U.K., Denmark and Norway) to
   construct species-area relationships for woodland birds. An additional
   relationship for Sweden was obtained from the literature. Species
   richness, and the parameters of the species-area relationships, were
   then related to the latitude, longitude and percentage woodland cover of
   each study area. Overall, species richness across all woods in each
   study area declined with increasing latitude; the proportion of resident
   species also declined, but that of migrants increased. Numbers of
   migrant species also increased with increasing woodland cover. Both the
   slopes and intercepts of the species-area relationships declined with
   increasing latitude. Thus not only were fewer species available to
   colonise individual woods at higher latitudes, but the return in terms
   of species richness for a given increase in area was also less than at
   lower latitudes. From the species-area relationships, the numbers of
   species expected to breed in woods of 1 ha and of 15 ha decreased from
   13 and 21, respectively, in The Netherlands (latitude 51.7 degrees) to 7
   and 13, respectively, in Denmark (latitude 56.3 degrees). Other factors
   influencing species richness on both local and geographical scales are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {In ducks and geese intraclutch egg-size variation shows a consistent
   pattern. The first egg is generally smaller than the second egg and from
   then on egg size declines over the laying sequence. Such an intraclutch
   egg-size pattern has previously been described in the Common Elder
   Somateria mollissima. In our study area the differences between the
   largest and the smallest egg in a clutch increased on average from 7.5\%
   among 3-egg clutches to 14.2\% among 6-egg clutches. The maximum
   difference was as much as 25\% among 6-egg clutches. In the present
   study we examine the relationship between egg size, laying position and
   the growth of ducklings. We have done this by collecting complete
   clutches of which we knew the exact laying order and the size of all
   eggs, and transferred them to a standard incubator to hatch. We then fed
   ducklings ad lib and measured their growth rate in relation to egg size
   and laying order. There was a close relationship (r(2) = 0.82) between
   egg size and hatching body mass of ducklings. Large eggs in a clutch
   also produced relatively larger ducklings (in relation to egg size) at
   hatching than smaller eggs. Ducklings from large second eggs in a clutch
   had a higher body mass up to day 12 after hatching than ducklings from
   small final eggs. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   female elders allocate resources to eggs in their clutch differentially
   and that such an investment may affect growth rate and hence the chances
   of survival of the ducklings.},

Abstract = {Backcalculated lengths at the end of the first growth season in wild
   Atlantic salmon Salmo scalar differed significantly between parr
   smelting at age 1, 2 and 3 years over a period of 11 years (i.e.
   1983-1993). Mean body lengths of the respective age groups at the end of
   the first growth period were 11.1, 6.2 and 4.7 cm, respectively. The
   mean percentage distribution of fish smelting at age 1, 2 and 3 was 14,
   78 and 7\%, and the mean smelt age was 1.95 years. Mean lengths at
   smelting of age groups 1, 2 and 3 were 13.6, 15.8 and 17.5 cm,
   respectively. Females outnumbered males among the downstream migrating
   smelts with a mean sex ratio (females/males) estimated at 1.61, with a
   significant female surplus in 7 of the 11 years sampled. Of the smelts
   sampled, 14\% exhibited enlarged gonads indicative of parr maturation,
   and all were males (37\% of the parr males sampled). Mean annual smelt
   density from 1975 to 1996 was 13.4 individuals 100 m(-2) ranging between
   0.3-3.1 smelts 100 m(-2). Mean densities (100 m(-2)) of the smelts aged
   1, 2 and 3 years were 1.5, 9.3 and 0.9 fish, respectively. Mean annual
   biomass for the 22-year period (1975-1996) was estimated at 437 g 100

Abstract = {In some Norwegian regions conflicts between sheep farmers and wildlife

   order to gain more insight into the inhabitants' attitudes toward one
   carnivore species, opinions about the preferred size of the wolf
   population, attitudes and knowledge about wolves, and experience with
   animal-related activities were surveyed in southeastern Norway. The
   attitude typology identified by Kellert (1986) was applied. Of the total
   sample, 14\% wanted wolves extirpated in Norway, 37\% wanted the present
   population reduced, 40\% wanted it maintained, and 7\% wanted it
   increased. The proportion wanting wolves extirpated or reduced increased
   as the perceived size of the wolf population increased, age increased,
   and educational level decreased. The attitude profiles showed that old
   persons, pensioners, and those with only basic education expressed high
   dominionistic, high negativistic and high utilitarian, and low
   naturalistic scores, whereas young persons with higher education showed
   the reverse pattern.},

Abstract = {Population growth of Gyrodactylus salaris increased exponentially on
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smelts in laboratory experiments conducted
   at 12.0 degrees C. Furthermore, G. safaris was transmitted successfully
   from salmon smelt to parr at 0.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 20.0 parts per thousand
   salinity and reproduced in fresh water after direct transfer from 7.5
   parts per thousand (16 days), 20.0 parts per thousand (4 and 8 h), and
   33.0 parts per thousand (5, 15, and 30 min). No G. salaris were observed
   on salmon parr exposed to 33.0 parts per thousand for 60 min. The
   prevalence of G. salaris on wild salmon smelts caught approximately 25
   km from the river mouth in the Drammensfjord (surface salinity 2.0-3.5
   parts per thousand) was 71.2\% compared with 88.0\% on those from the
   neighbouring River Lierelva. Adult wild salmon caught as prespawners,
   spawners, and postspawners (kelts) in the River Drammenselva were
   infected with G. salaris. The prevalence and abundance increased from
   autumn to spring, in contrast with earlier studies on salmon parr,
   demonstrating the possible importance of adult salmon as reservoirs for
   G. safaris during winter. The results support the hypothesis of brackish
   water dispersal of G. safaris by infected salmonids migrating in
   estuaries and fjords. The use of salt as a disinfectant against G.
   safaris in hatcheries, and the stocking of possibly infected fish into
   brackish and seawater, should also be reexamined.},

Abstract = {The influence of the water quality of tributary streams on the relative
   abundance in benthic gillnet catches (catch per unit effort, cpue) of
   allopatric brown Salmo trutta was assessed in associated acidic,
   softwater lakes. The study was carried out over 6 years (1989-1994) in
   15 lakes located al altitudes between 230-715 m a.s.l. in two Norwegian
   catchments. The water quality of the main inlets and outlets varied
   little, as indicated by their of pH range (4.93-5.51) and calcium
   concentrations (0.19-0.44 mg l(-1)), but varied more with respect to
   concentrations of inorganic, monomeric aluminium (7.0-41.0 mu g l(-1)).
   Most of the lakes were also fed by secondary streams with better water
   quality: a maximum pH of 6.56, calcium levels of up to 0.74 mg l(-1),
   and inorganic aluminium levels as low as 1.0 mu g l(-1). The cpue was
   inversely correlated with lake altitude (r(2)=0.50), and thus was
   adjusted to a mean altitude. The calcium concentration in the richest
   secondary stream to each lake, its richness judged on the basis of its
   acid-neutralizing capacity, had the highest predictive power of the
   variability in cpue (r(2)=0.49). The calcium content in the other
   secondary streams or in the main inlets and outlets did not correlate
   with cpue. Alkalinity in the main outlets correlated to some extent with
   cpue (r(2)=0.27). It is suggested that secondary streams with good water
   quality provide important refuges for the recruitment of brown trout in
   acidic softwater lakes. (C) 1998 The Fisheries Society of the British

Title = {Effects of acidification due to emissions from the Kola Peninsula on
   fish populations in lakes near the Russian border in Northern Norway},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {102},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper we document the effects of acidification on fish
   populations in lakes in Sor-Varanger near the Russian border in northern
   Norway. We used questionnaires in order to assess the current status and
   distribution of different fish species, and conducted test-fishing to
   determine relative abundance (CPUE-T) and age structure. Acidification
   of surface waters in this area is due to emissions of SO2 from smelters
   on the Kola Peninsula in Russia (Nikel and Zapoljarnij) between 10 and
   30 km from the Norwegian border. Sulphur deposition in Sor-Varanger
   ranges from 0.6 to 2.0 g S m(-2) yr(-1), which is similar to levels in
   the most acidified areas in southern Norway. However, a dominant
   fraction of the acidic deposition reaches the ground in particulate form
   during summer and autumn. Coastal areas in Sor-Varanger receive small
   amounts of precipitation; the annual mean is 580 mm. We obtained fish
   status from 401 lakes, about 40\% of all lakes larger than 3 ha, which
   were inhabited by 236 and 293 populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus
   alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), respectively. The extent of
   fish damage was small as only three populations of Arctic charr were
   lost, while three populations of Arctic charr and eight populations of
   brown trout were at various stages of reduction. Damaged and lost fish
   populations were identified in smaller lakes at relatively high
   elevations (172-349 m) in six areas in the Jarfjord Mountains, covering
   a land area of 30.0 km(2). Most of the damage probably occurred during
   the 1970s and 1980s. In lakes that supported or had supported Arctic
   charr and brown trout, we found a significant relationship between
   CPUE-T, and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and pH, and also between
   alkalinity and the concentration of inorganic Al for brown trout. In
   both species, the catch of fish in age groups 1+ and 2+ (CPUE-R)
   increased significantly with CPUE-T. Affected populations typically
   exhibited irregular age composition, and age-classes were missing,
   indicating that reductions in fish populations were due to recruitment
   failure. The limited fish damage is related to relatively good catchment
   resistance to acidic inputs, small amounts of wet deposition as well as
   precipitation. These conditions result in low accumulation of acidic
   compounds, producing less acidic run-off waters and few episodes of
   unfavourable water quality.},

Journal = {ARDEA},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {86},

Pages = {51-58},
Abstract = {Winter north of the Arctic circle in northern Norway is colder, windier
   and there is less solar radiation than in eastern Scotland, at a
   latitude 13 degrees further south. We predicted from equations derived
   from heated taxidermic mounts that the maintenance metabolism (Basal
   Metabolic Rate plus extra costs for thermoregulation) for Purple
   Sandpipers Calidris maritima wintering in these climatic conditions in
   Norway would be 1.3 times greater than for Purple Sandpipers of the same
   size in Scotland. Adaptations to the more extreme environment and
   greater energy requirements were investigated by measuring differences
   in the body size and composition of Purple Sandpipers from northern
   Norway and Scotland. As predicted, the Norwegian Purple Sandpipers had
   more fat stores, but these were still at relatively low levels (6.5\% of
   fresh body mass) compared with other waders wintering in cold climates.
   The Norwegian birds were slightly larger so will probably have a
   relatively lower thermal conductance than Scottish birds. Also, there
   were large differences in the relative sizes of the intestine (1.5 times
   heavier in Norwegian birds) and liver (1.3 times heavier). This suggests
   Bat Purple Sandpipers wintering in Norway eat and process a greater
   amount of food than the birds in Scotland. Ln this way, the additional
   energy demands for thermoregulation in a colder environment are probably
   met.},

   Patterns of Change in Atlantic Salmon, BRAEMAR, SCOTLAND, MAR, 1997},
Abstract = {The breeding system of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is shaped both by
   natural selection for offspring production and by sexual selection for
   access to mating opportunities. These evolutionary forces operate with
   differing intensities in the two sexes to shape their breeding behaviour
   and tactics. Female breeding success is largely dependent on egg
   production, access to breeding territories, and nest quality and
   survival. By contrast, male breeding success is largely determined by
   access to ovipositing females. As such, the breeding system of Atlantic
   salmon is similar to that of other members of the subfamily Salmoninae.
   However, early male maturity, a common pattern within the Salmoninae,
   reaches its greatest expression in both terms of frequency and magnitude
   of the mature male size difference in Atlantic salmon. Despite
   generalities, spawning populations of Atlantic salmon are not static, as

Abstract = {A variety of movements characterize the behavioral plasticity of
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in fresh water, including movements of fry
   from redds, establishment of feeding territories, spawning movements of
   sexually mature male parr, movement to and from winter habitat, and
   smelt migration in spring. Smelting is an adaptive specialization for
   downstream migration, seawater entry, and marine residence. While still
   in fresh water, smelts become silvery and streamlined, lose their
   positive rheotaxis and territoriality, and begin schooling.
   Physiological changes include increased salinity tolerance, olfactory
   sensitivity, metabolic rate, scope for growth, and altered hemoglobin
   and visual pigments. Through their impact on the neuroendocrine system,
   photoperiod and temperature regulate physiological changes, whereas
   temperature and water flow may initiate migration. Smelt survival is
   affected by a limited period of readiness (a physiological ``smolt
   window{''}) and the timing of seawater entry with environmental
   conditions such as temperature, food, and predators (an ecological
   ``smolt window{''}). Smelt development is adversely affected by acidity,
   pollutants, and improper rearing conditions, and is often more sensitive
   than other life stages. Unfortunately, the migration corridor of smelts
   (mainstems of rivers and estuaries) are the most heavily impacted by
   pollution, darns, and other anthropogenic activities that may be
   directly lethal or increase mortality by delaying or inhibiting smelt
   migration.},

Abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are distributed over large areas in the
   north Atlantic Ocean. They usually move very quickly from freshwater to
   oceanic areas, whereas there is considerable variation among Pacific
   salmon in early marine movements. In some areas, Atlantic salmon of
   exploitable size are sufficiently abundant that commercial high seas
   fisheries have developed. Such areas are off west Greenland, where North
   American and European fish are harvested, and in the Norwegian Sea,
   north of the Faroe Islands, where mainly European fish are exploited.
   Atlantic salmon feed on a wide range of large crustaceans, pelagic fish,
   and squid in the marine environment, supporting the hypothesis that
   Atlantic salmon are opportunistic feeders. In the ocean the salmon grow
   relatively quickly and the sea age when they become sexually mature
   depends on both genetics and on growing conditions. Natural marine
   mortality of salmon is highest during the first few months at sea and
   the major mortality factor is probably predation. However, marine
   mortality of Atlantic salmon has increased in recent years, apparently
   correlated with a decline in sea surface temperatures. Similar
   relationships between environmental conditions and the growth and
   survival of Pacific salmon have been reported. Atlantic salmon life
   histories most closely mimic stream-type chinook salmon or steelhead
   trout among the Pacific species. Finally, Atlantic and Pacific salmon
   return to their home rivers with high precision and possible mechanisms
   controlling the oceanic homing migration are presented and discussed.},

Abstract = {The need for integration across spatial and temporal scales in applying
   science to the management of Atlantic salmon is considered. The factors
   that are currently believed to affect the production of anadromous adult
   Atlantic salmon (synthesized from recent reviews) are arranged in a
   hierarchy in which any given process overrides those processes at lower
   levels. There is not a good correlation between levels in the process
   hierarchy and levels in hierarchies of scale. This demonstrates the
   importance of integrating across scales in identifying the optimum foci
   for targeting management action. It is not possible to generalize on the
   need for integration across scales within management plans. This is
   because of the complex ecology of salmon, the broad range of
   characteristics of the systems of which they are a part, and the fact
   that both local scale and broad scale management can have broad scale
   effects. Many uncertainties remain regarding the large-scale components
   of the ecology of salmon, the way that small-scale mechanisms interact
   with life histories, and the way that different factors interact to
   limit production of fish. When more is understood of these processes, it
   is likely that generalized rules might be developed to predict the
   management requirements for stream systems. In the meantime, it is
   essential that there is good integration among managers working at
   different scales and it is important that management systems operating
   at all spatial scales include high-calibre expertise to compensate for
   the present paucity of general rules.},

Abstract = {The influence of sperm competition and individual mating behaviour in an
   externally fertilizing species of fish, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar), is estimated from video observations of multiple-male spawnings
   and subsequent paternity analyses. One male dominated the paternity
   during polygamous spawnings, fathering mere than 80\% of the progeny in
   a single nest. Behavioural analyses of the spawnings showed that the
   first-mating male had sperm precedence in 6 out of 10 cases. In three of
   the other spawnings, sperm limitation likely influenced individual
   success, as the first-mating male had participated in a large number of
   spawnings. In the final, nearly simultaneous spawning, male size was
   more important than the 0.6-s difference in spawning times. Thus, male
   fertilization success can be influenced by a variety of factors,
   including sperm precedence, male size, and spawning history.},

Abstract = {The kelp Laminaria hyperborea is regularly harvested along the Norwegian
   coast. Kelp trawling is regulated by restricting this to every 5th year
   in specified areas. The kelp plants form dense forests, 1-2 m high, and
   house a large number of epiphytes and associated invertebrates. Kelp,
   epiphytes, and holdfast (hapteron) fauna were sampled at two different
   regions in untrawled kelp forest and at sites trawled different number
   of years ago. We have examined the rate of kelp regrowth after trawling,
   and in what time scale the associated flora and fauna colonize the
   trawled areas. The trawl removed all adult kelp plants (the canopy
   plants), while small understorey kelp plants were left undisturbed.
   These recruits, given improved Light conditions, made the new generation
   of canopy-forming kelp plants, exceeding a height of 1 m within 2-3 y.
   The recruitment pattern of the kelp ensures maintenance of kelp forest
   dominance despite repeated trawling. Both percent cover, abundance and
   number of epiphytic species increased with time post trawling, but
   epiphytic communities were not totally re-established before the next
   trawling episode. Colonization of most species of fauna inhabiting the
   kelp holdfast were found as early as one year after trawling, but
   increasing size of the habitat by age of kelp gave room for increasing
   numbers of both individuals and species. Slow colonization rate by some
   species might be due to low dispersal potential. Due to a higher
   maximum-age and size of kelp plants in the northernmost region studied,
   restoration of both kelp and kelp forest community was slower there.},

Abstract = {The introduction of `Catch and Release' fishery programs are now widely
   employed by fisheries managers in most Atlantic Provinces, primarily due
   to the recent decline of Atlantic salmon stocks on the east coast of
   Canada. However, there is still considerable debate among special
   interest groups and regulators as to the effectiveness of the technique.
   Heart rate telemetry has been utilized as a tool for the assessment of
   metabolic rate in wild fish by a number of investigators, and was
   employed in the present study in order to assess recovery following
   staged angling events in Atlantic salmon. Wild Atlantic salmon were
   successfully angled at 20 +/- 2 degrees C and 16.5 +/- 1 degrees C at
   Noel Paul's Brook, Newfoundland. In addition, hatchery reared Atlantic
   salmon were angled at the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
   Research Station, Alma, Ontario, at a temperature of 8 +/- 1 degrees C.
   Survival rate for the angled salmon was 20\% at 20 +/- 2 degrees C;
   100\% at 16.5 +/- 1 degrees C; and 100\% at 8 +/- 1 degrees C. Mean
   resting heart rate for the fish angled at 16.5 degrees C and 20 degrees
   C was approximately 1.6 and 1.8 times greater than that of fish angled
   at 8 degrees C. Heart rate, post angling, was found to increase 1.2 fold
   in the 8 degrees C group, 1.3 fold in the 16.5 degrees C group and
   approximately 1.15 fold in the 20 degrees C group. Time to recovery was
   assessed asa return to observed resting heart rate for each individual
   fish and was found to be similar for both the 8 degrees C and 16.5
   degrees C angled groups (approximately 16 h). Although heart rate
   telemetry in fish is, perhaps, not an ideal measure of metabolic rate,
   the present study has demonstrated that remote monitoring of heart rate
   is a good indicator of post exercise physiological activity.},

Abstract = {High mortality-rates of seaward migrating salmonid smelts when passing
   reservoirs and lakes have earlier been found in the Danish River Gudena
   watershed. To reveal the causes of mortality of migrating smelts in Lake
   Tange, a 12 km long, shallow reservoir, 50 salmon smelts and 24 trout
   smelts were tagged with internal miniature radio-transmitters, and
   released in the river just upstream the reservoir on May 1, 1996. The
   salmon smelts were hatchery-reared, while the trout smelts were wild
   fish, caught in a smelt trap. The tagged smelts were tracked daily for 3
   weeks, and when possible the cause of death was determined. During the
   3-week period, 90\% of the tagged smelts died. The main cause of death
   for both trout and salmon was predation from fish and birds. The most
   important predator was pike (Esox lucius L.), being responsible for 56\%
   of the observed mortality. Avian predators were assumed to be
   responsible for 31\% of the observed mortality. No trout smelts left the
   reservoir, but 5 salmon-smelts got out through the turbines. Others did
   traverse the reservoir, but were unable to enter the river downstream,
   and were later eaten. The present results suggest that mortalities for
   migrating smolts through Lake Tange are of such a magnitude, that
   stocking of juveniles in the river upstream is futile, and further, that
   the establishment of a natural population of salmon or sea-trout in
   river Gudena, upstream Tange, is unrealistic under present conditions.},

Abstract = {Radioactive caesium (20-60 kBq m(-2)) was deposited after the Chernobyl
   accident in the mountains of central Norway. Two sympatric ptarmigan
   species, willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus and rock ptarmigan L. mutus,
   inhabit this alpine ecosystem and are important game species. In 1987
   and 1988, a study was carried out to try to identify factors affecting
   radioactive caesium concentration in these birds. Juvenile willow
   ptarmigan contained more radiocaesium than adults, but the two sexes did
   not differ in radiocaesium concentration. The radiocaesium concentration
   of food plants correlated with radiocaesium concentration of rock
   ptarmigan, and a seasonal variation in radiocaesium concentration of
   both ptarmigan species was seen. Rock ptarmigan contained more
   radiocaesium than willow ptarmigan during winter, but not in summer.
   This difference was related to differences in diet. The bioconcentration
   factor was 0.4-0.6. The aggregated transfer coefficient was 0.003-0.009
   m(2) kg(-1) for both species. In spite of the high deposition, the
   radiocaesium concentration in muscle rarely exceeded the limit
   recommended for human food consumption (600 Bq kg(-1)). (C) 1998

Title = {Population dynamics of the Echinomermella matsi (Nematoda) -
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Echinoida) system: effects on host
   fecundity},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {193-201},
Abstract = {At high population densities the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
   droebachiensis can affect subtidal community structure significantly by
   grazing down kelp beds to barren grounds. The parasitic nematode
   Echinomermella matsi has been suggested to reduce sea urchin population
   densities at barren ground localities, thereby giving rise to kelp
   recovery and possibly a cyclic behaviour between these states. Here, we
   evaluated the potential of E. matsi to affect host population dynamics
   through effects on host fertility. This was done by estimating the
   effect of infection on the host population gonad mass at 4 localities,
   ranging from barren ground to a kelp bed. The relationship between sea
   urchin gonad wet weight, sea urchin size and worm burden was modelled
   statistically. From this model we estimated the effect of infection at
   the host population level. We found a strong negative relationship
   between gonad wet weight of sea urchins and the wet weight of their
   nematode infrapopulations. In some animals this reduction in gonad
   development was estimated to be 100\%, indicating functional castration.
   At the host population level, the relative reduction in gonad mass due
   to infection was less than 10\% at all sample sites, and was in the same
   range both in the kelp forest and on the barren grounds. The main reason
   for this low population effect of infection is that most sea urchins
   carry low worm burdens, which will have a small effect on host gonads.
   Compared to the effect of inter-site differences in sea urchin size on
   mean gonad sizes, the effect of infection on mean gonad size was found
   to be small. We therefore suggest that processes that determine sea
   urchin size distributions, such as survival and growth, are likely to be
   more important in the determination of local reproductive potential than
   direct effects of infection on gonad development.},

Title = {Dispersal in willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus - who is dispersing and

Year = {1998},

Abstract = {Rorvik, K.-A., Pedersen, H.C. \& Steen, J.B. 1998: Dispersal in willow
   ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus - who is dispersing and why? - Wildl. Biol. 4:
   91-96.
   The present study evaluates dispersal among breeding willow ptarmigan
   Lagopus lagopus in five closely located subareas in central Norway.
   During a six-year period, breeding territorial ptarmigan were
   live-trapped, aged, sexed and genotyped. Since it is believed that
   female willow ptarmigan are the dispersing sex, and foreign intruders
   are expected to be more genetically different than birds from the natal
   subarea, it is predicted that the genetic similarity between breeding
   birds of a given year (t) and the breeders in the same territories the
   next year (t+l) would be greater for males than for females. The extent
   of dispersal is believed to be positively correlated with the intruder
   pressure. Thus, the genetic similarity outlined above is predicted to be
   greatest in comparisons where chick production in year t was lowest.
   Analysis of genetic similarity among territorial birds in two
   consecutive breeding seasons revealed no significant difference between
   males and females. However, males showed greater genetic variability
   between years than females. For both yearling and adult males, the
   increased variation coincided with changes in the population density.
   Hence, a significant relationship between genetic similarity and chick
   production for both yearling and adult males was observed. This may
   suggest density-dependent dispersal for males, but not for females. The
   fact that there was a stronger relationship between genetic similarity
   and natal chick production, than between genetic similarity and mean
   chick production on all subareas, for both adult sexes, suggests that
   breeding adults are more often challenged by yearlings from their own
   subarea than by foreign intruders from neighbouring areas.},

Abstract = {Bevanger, K. \& Broseth, H. 1998: Body temperature changes in
   wild-living badgers Meles meles through the winter. - Wildl. Biol. 4:
   97-101.
   In central Norway, the body temperatures of two wild-living badgers
   Meles meles, one male and one female, were recorded in the morning and
   evening from early November to late March using an implanted
   temperature-sensitive radio transmitter. The external ambient and
   internal sett temperatures were also recorded. Both badgers showed a
   general decrease in their mean daily body temperature from early
   November until the second half of December, followed by a general
   increase until the beginning of March. The reduction in body temperature
   for both animals was around 2-3 degrees C. The female spent most of the
   winter under a building, in a crawl space where the internal temperature
   varied from +4 degrees C to -11 degrees C, being strongly influenced by
   the external ambient temperature. The male spent the winter in a natural
   sett where the temperature was rather constant (+2-5 degrees C), and
   where the external ambient temperature had little influence on the
   internal sett temperature. However, the external ambient temperature
   only accounted for 11 and 12\% of the observed body temperature
   variations in the male and female, respectively. When the length of
   daylight was compared with the body temperatures, it was found to
   account for 60 and 30\% of the variations in the male and female
   temperatures, respectively. Thus, the data indicate that the
   photoperiod, at its minimum at the winter solstice, acted as the primary
   synchroniser of the body temperature cycle in the badgers during their
   winter lethargy.},

   Results of a large-scale experiment},

Abstract = {Landa, A., Krogstad, S., Tommeras, B.A. \& Tufto, J. 1998: Do volatile
   repellents reduce wolverine Gulo gulo predation on sheep? Results of a
   large-scale experiment. - Wildl. Biol. 4: 111-118.
   Experiments with captive wolverines Gulo gulo showed that oils and
   chemicals gave distinct avoidance reactions. In 1993 and 1994, volatile
   repellents were tested on lambs in free-ranging flocks and significantly
   fewer lambs were lost in treated groups than in untreated groups. In
   1996, the effects of repellents were tested when wolverines did not have
   lambs without repellents as alternative prey. The experiment was carried
   out in four different areas where high losses of lambs due to wolverine
   predation had been observed in recent years. The flocks were monitored
   by environmental officers throughout the season. There were relatively
   few technical problems with the repellents, except that some ear tags
   were lost during the grazing season. The effect of the repellent was
   tested on two different time scales, a survival model based on 15 years
   of data and a model based on a narrow time window, comparing the results
   of the test year with the losses in the previous year. Losses of lambs
   increased from 1983 to 1996 and were highest in years in which
   wolverines reproduced within the areas concerned. Both models showed
   that the use of volatile repellents on all lambs did not reduce losses
   in either of the four areas. In one of the areas (Ulvadalen), the losses
   were higher in 1996 than in 1995. In the other three areas, no
   difference was found between 1995 and 1996, suggesting that the
   wolverines had become habituated to a situation where all the lambs in a
   relatively large area were treated with repellents. Based on the results
   of former surveys as well as the present survey, we conclude that this
   particular repellent is only a potential tool which may be used to
   reduce losses in target groups of sheep and that repellents cannot be
   recommended as a general tool to reduce wolverine predation on sheep.},

Title = {The diet of brown bears Ursus arctos in central Scandinavia: effect of
   access to free-ranging domestic sheep Ovis aries},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {147-158},
Abstract = {The seasonal food habits of brown bears Ursus arctos were estimated
   based on the analysis of 266 scats in central Norway and Sweden.
   Free-ranging domestic sheep Ovis aries were common in the Norwegian part
   of the study area, but were not found in the Swedish part. Correction
   factors were used to correct for differences in digestibility and
   nutritional value of different foods. Because correction factors for
   ungulates are difficult to estimate, the results should be interpreted
   with some caution. In terms of digestible energy, ungulates, mostly
   carrion, were the most important food in both areas during spring.
   During summer, ants, forbs, and ungulates (reindeer Rangifer tarandus
   and moose Alces alces) were the most important food items in the Swedish
   area, and sheep were most important in the Norwegian area. The autumn
   diet was dominated by berries in the Swedish area and sheep and berries
   in the Norwegian area. Among berries, crowberry Empetrum nigrum was the
   most important species, followed by bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus in
   Sweden. The major difference between the Swedish and Norwegian areas was
   the large consumption of sheep in Norway, which provided protein and
   lipids, and was associated with a relatively reduced consumption of ants
   and forbs in summer and berries in the autumn. Based on different
   ingestion rates among the seasons, we estimated the relative
   contribution of major foods to total digestible energy. In the Swedish
   area, bears obtained 44-46 and 14-30\% of their total annual energy from
   berries and ungulates, respectively. The remaining energy was obtained
   from insects (14-22\%, mostly ants) and forbs and graminoids (12-18\%,
   mostly blue sow thistle Cicerbita alpina). In Norway, bears obtained
   65-87\% of the energy from ungulates (mostly sheep), 6-17\% from
   berries, 5-13\% from insects, and 2-6\% from forbs and graminoids. To
   gain weight prior to denning, brown bears in Norway selected lipid-rich
   and easily obtainable sheep in summer and autumn. In Sweden, they relied
   on carbohydrate-rich berries in autumn.},

Title = {Active wolverine Gulo gulo dens as a minimum population estimator in
   Scandinavia},

Abstract = {Minimum numbers of wolverines Gulo gulo were estimated for Scandinavia,
   based on the average number of active dens recorded in 1995-1997. To
   estimate the proportion of females active at dens, we followed
   individual females using radio-telemetry in northern Sweden, northern
   Norway and south-central Norway. The sex and age structure of the
   population was estimated based on a sample of wolverines harvested
   before the introduction of protective measures and harvest restrictions.
   Our results are compared with those found in other published wolverine
   studies, mostly from North America. The Scandinavian population of
   one-year-old and older wolverines was estimated at 413 +/- 71 (SD)
   individuals (265 +/- 55 in Sweden and 147 +/- 25 in Norway). This method
   gave a lower population estimate than those found in earlier surveys
   based on summation of local (municipality) estimates (Troms) and on
   local tracking surveys (Nordland). The differences may be explained by
   the existence of a large number of undiscovered natal dens in the two
   counties mentioned above, but the previous estimates were based on
   methodologies with sources of error that could inflate estimates. The
   population size in south-central Norway (the Snohetta plateau,
   Trollheimen, Reinheimen and Rondane), based on the average number of
   active natal dens during 1995-1997, was estimated to be 26 +/- 7
   individuals. This was in concordance with the 23-30 individuals
   estimated from intensive tracking and radio-telemetry in spring 1995.
   Monitoring wolverine reproduction as a basis for population estimates
   could provide an important management tool. Based on our results, we
   recommend that the management authorities in Norway closely monitor the
   presently high harvest rate of wolverines in parts of the country, and
   establish population monitoring methods that allow continuous evaluation
   of management strategies.},
